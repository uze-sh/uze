# Invariants

Properties that hold today, each guarded by a test rather than by intent. They
are recorded here because they are what the architecture *is*: a future change
that breaks one is not a refactor, it is a different product.

Every entry names the test that fails if the property stops holding. A claim
with no such test does not belong on this page.

## Vendor neutrality (M1)

### Store owns packages, not harness artifacts

The Store writes package bytes and its own registry. It never writes anything
a harness reads.

> `tests/integrations/vendor_neutral.rs::the_store_writes_no_harness_owned_artifact_of_its_own_accord`

### Integrations own vendor semantics

Which packages belong in a harness-owned view, what shape that view takes, and
when it is rebuilt are decisions of the integration that owns the harness.

> `tests/integrations/vendor_neutral.rs::a_package_without_the_native_envelope_is_not_published`

### Adding a harness requires no semantic change to Store, Engine, Router or the package model

Proven by adding a fifth harness with a materially different native delivery:
Codex needs a published catalogue, Antigravity CLI needs neither but
*copies* (its `agy plugin install` stages bytes — no link verb exists), and
both go through the same `IntegrationPort`.

> `tests/integrations/vendor_neutral.rs::the_store_contains_no_source_mechanism_semantics`
> `tests/integrations/vendor_neutral.rs::no_core_module_depends_on_acquisition`

### Package publication and package-native delivery are independent

`republish_packages` maintains a derived view; `attach_package` performs a
native delivery. Codex uses both. Antigravity uses only the second — its
`republish_packages` is never overridden.

> `tests/integrations/vendor_neutral.rs::a_derived_view_is_rebuilt_from_the_package_set_alone`
> `tests/integrations/vendor_neutral.rs::republish_is_a_noop_for_an_integration_that_publishes_nothing`

### A failed derived view never invalidates an installation

One harness failing to publish leaves the package installed, the other
harnesses untouched, and the failure observable through `doctor`.

> `tests/integrations/vendor_neutral.rs::a_failed_publication_leaves_the_package_installed_and_says_so`

### The Codex generated envelope is self-contained

Codex stages a plugin into its own cache without following symlinks, so a
generated Codex envelope carries real bytes: every default-policy Skill and
the `.mcp.json` are mirrored from the Store, a symlink the package keeps
inside itself is resolved to the file it names, and a link that escapes the
package is refused by name rather than dropped. The envelope is still a
Derived Artifact (ADR-013 §5, amended): rebuilt wholesale from the Store on
every materialization, never authoritative.

> `skill-invocation-policy` (`default-skill-offered` through Codex's own
> plugin cache) and the `/mcp` inventory check in phase `tui`.

### `uze-core` production logic never names a specific harness

No line of `uze-core`'s production code (outside its own test fixtures)
names Claude, Codex, OpenCode, or Antigravity — as an identifier or
a string literal. Strengthened by ADR-005: a foreign-format importer that
once named Claude here (`ClaudePluginImporter`, acquisition-time, never
delivery-time) was confirmed dead — unreachable from `Store::ingest` or
any other production path — and removed; the invariant now holds with no
carved-out exception.

> `tests/integrations/identity.rs::core_never_names_a_vendor_harness`

### The Application and CLI/TUI never name a harness either

`uze-application` orchestrates integrations it knows only through
`IntegrationPort`; the CLI/TUI consume registry descriptors and read
models. All concrete harness knowledge — construction, display metadata,
context-delivery mode, shim names — lives in `uze-integrations`, with one
composition root (`IntegrationRegistry::builtin`/`isolated`) naming the
built-in set. A comment explaining a generic mechanism may cite a vendor;
live code may not.

> `tests/integrations/identity.rs::application_never_names_a_vendor_harness`
> `tests/integrations/identity.rs::cli_and_tui_never_name_a_vendor_harness`

### One composition root owns the built-in integration set

`crates/uze-integrations/src/registry.rs` is the single production place
that constructs the concrete integration types (env-based `builtin` and
isolated `isolated`); application, the runtime shim, and the README
matrix all consume the registry. A new harness needs one vertical, one
registry entry, conformance, and docs — nothing in core/application/
CLI/TUI.

> `crates/uze-integrations/src/registry.rs` tests
> `tests/integrations/vendor_neutral.rs::harness_selection_comes_from_the_registered_integrations`

### Project-context delivery is declared per integration

Which harness reads the shared `AGENTS.md` natively, which needs an
`@AGENTS.md` bridge region, and which additional native files are
observed for portability reporting is each integration's
`context_delivery()` declaration — never an Application-owned vendor
list. The bridge protocol itself (region identity, import line) is the
Application's, shared by every bridge-needing harness.

> `tests/memory/inspection.rs` scenarios A–F (stub harness declares its
> bridge exactly like a real integration)

### Native means preserved semantics, not identical primitives (ADR-030)

A route is **Native** when a harness offers a first-class, officially
supported mechanism that preserves the canonical semantics of the
capability. It does **not** require the same vendor name, file format, or
physical primitive across vendors: UZE models user-visible semantics, and
the same canonical capability may legitimately be Native on every harness
through differently-named primitives. The canonical capability is the
Skill, and its semantics are *who may invoke it* (invocation policy,
ADR-030). A user-only Skill is Native on Claude Code via
`disable-model-invocation: true` and on Codex via
`agents/openai.yaml` → `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false`, even
though both deliver a Skill-shaped artifact; a vendor `Command` is only a
projection detail it may be generated from. The same definition is what
makes Antigravity's non-default policies **Adapted** rather than Native:
its only primitive is Skills that are both model-discoverable and
slash-invocable, so neither half of a non-default policy is preserved —
the loss is declared in the evidence, never silently covered. Package
exact coverage is semantic-aware: an envelope only claims a Skill when the
policy is actually preserved (`provided = discovered ∩ safely
representable`).

> `crates/uze-integrations/src/claude/generate.rs::generated_native_tests::user_only_skill_is_materialized_with_the_claude_marker`

### A Skill nobody may invoke is never projected (ADR-030)

`invoke: {model: false, user: false}` is invalid — it is parsed and kept
explicit (never silently defaulted to a model-visible or user-visible
combination), every integration routes it Unsupported, and no receipt,
symlink or generated file is ever created for it.

> `tests/integrations/policy.rs::invalid_policy_never_creates_a_receipt_anywhere`
> `crates/uze-core/src/capability/skill.rs::invalid_combination_is_kept_explicit_never_defaulted`

### Existing Skills without `invoke:` behave exactly as before (ADR-030)

The canonical default is model+user; a SKILL.md with no `invoke:` block is
discovered with no parsed policy (defaults apply), delivered byte-preserving
where it always was, and never gains a policy sidecar it did not declare.

> `tests/integrations/policy.rs::default_skill_package_installs_cleanly_on_every_harness_as_before`

> `crates/uze-core/src/capability.rs::skill_without_invocation_block_defaults_and_is_not_reattached`

### A loose Skill is a directory of its own, and every root has one owner

A Skill delivered outside a plugin is a regular directory in its harness's
own root: the rendered `SKILL.md`, whatever the harness reads beside it,
and the canonical supporting files copied. Nothing in it is a link, and
nothing resolves into the Store: OpenCode does not walk a linked skill
root, Codex does not list a linked `SKILL.md`. Its receipt is the
directory's `tree_sha256`, so an edit is drift UZE leaves in place, and a
directory with no receipt is not UZE's to replace. No two integrations
write one root, so no directory carries two vendors' encodings and no
removal has to ask who else still holds it. An entry an earlier build
linked there is retired before the directory takes its place.

> `tests/integrations/lifecycle_conformance.rs::every_integration_owns_its_skill_root`

### `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` names a delivered copy, never the Store

Every `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` a harness receives, in a skill, an agent, an MCP
server or a hook, names `runtime/packages/<id>`: the whole package, copied
from the Store before any harness is handed it. A hook that builds into its
root writes that copy, which the next delivery restores, and never the bytes
`agents.lock` pins.

> `tests/projection/skill_roots.rs::the_plugin_root_a_skill_names_is_a_delivered_copy_never_the_store`
> `crates/uze-core/src/delivery/delivered_root.rs::the_delivered_root_is_a_copy_a_write_cannot_carry_into_the_store`

### A generated directory is replaced whole

A directory a harness reads is built beside its destination and swapped in
with one rename, so a reader sees one build: Claude Code reads a
directory-marketplace plugin live from its source. A failed build leaves
the previous tree and no staging behind.

> `crates/uze-core/src/delivery/persistence.rs::tests::a_replaced_directory_holds_only_the_new_tree`

> `crates/uze-core/src/delivery/persistence.rs::tests::something_other_than_a_directory_is_never_replaced`

### Invocation labels are stable and presentation-only (ADR-026)

Plugin capabilities exposed through UZE carry a stable, plugin-qualified
invocation label (`<plugin>:<capability>`) as their single naming
candidate: deterministic, predictable, independent of installation order
and of which other plugins are installed, with no bare aliases. The label is
a presentation concern — canonical Resource identity, Store bytes, package
layout, coverage identities (`provided_resource_identities`) and capability
bodies are untouched — and the vendor integration owns the physical
encoding (Claude's native plugin namespace, Codex/OpenCode/Antigravity
verbatim `flow:review`).

## Acquisition and provenance (M2)

### Acquisition owns source semantics

Every source mechanism lives in `src/acquisition/`. Nothing else resolves,
fetches or interprets an origin.

### Store owns installed package bytes

The Store receives a materialized directory. It does not know how the bytes
got there and does not need the origin afterwards — an installed package keeps
working, and stays safely removable, after its source directory is deleted.

### Store persists provenance but does not interpret source mechanisms

Provenance reaches the Store as an opaque value it stores and compares through
`Provenance::same_origin`. It never matches a variant or reads a field.

> `tests/integrations/vendor_neutral.rs::the_store_contains_no_source_mechanism_semantics`

### One unreadable registration never takes the registry with it

`packages.json` is a ledger of independent registrations, so an entry this
UZE cannot read — a key that is not a valid qualified id, or a value whose
fields it does not know — is quarantined, never fatal. The
readable entries stay listable, resolvable and removable; the quarantined one
answers to nothing and the next save drops it. `doctor` reports it as a named
state carrying its remedy, not as the serde error that produced it.

> `crates/uze-core/src/package/store.rs::tests::an_entry_with_unreadable_fields_is_quarantined_and_named`
> `crates/uze-core/src/package/store.rs::tests::load_registry_quarantines_a_tampered_entry_without_losing_valid_ones`
> `crates/uze-application/src/application/doctor.rs::tests::doctor_names_an_unreadable_registration_and_its_remedy`

### An interrupted install never blocks the next one

An install that dies between the copy and the registration leaves a plugin
directory nothing in the registry names. Reaching the copy means nothing
claims that id, so the debris is cleared and the second attempt succeeds —
and an ingest that fails part-way removes what it wrote, because `remove`
answers only to registered ids and could not have cleaned up after it.

> `tests/packages/store.rs::an_install_interrupted_mid_copy_never_blocks_the_next_attempt`
> `tests/packages/store.rs::a_failed_ingest_leaves_no_directory_behind`

### Remote mutable references resolve to immutable Git commits

A branch, a tag and an unspecified reference all persist as a commit SHA. The
default branch is read from the remote, never guessed from a hardcoded name.

> `tests/packages/acquisition.rs::a_branch_resolves_to_an_immutable_commit`
> `tests/packages/acquisition.rs::a_tag_resolves_to_an_immutable_commit`
> `tests/packages/acquisition.rs::an_unspecified_reference_resolves_the_repositorys_own_default_branch`

### Reinstall uses resolved provenance; update re-resolves requested provenance

Reinstalling stays at the recorded commit even after the branch has moved.
Updating asks the original request again and may land on a new commit.

> `tests/packages/acquisition.rs::reinstalling_a_resolved_commit_stays_at_that_commit`
> `tests/packages/acquisition.rs::updating_re_resolves_the_request_and_moves_with_the_branch`

A local path has no immutable revision, and the model does not pretend
otherwise: reinstall and update both re-read the directory as it is now.

### Installed packages are self-contained

No symlink the Store persists may resolve outside the package root. Every
source is held to the same rule, and validation runs before any byte is
written, so a rejected package leaves nothing behind.

> `tests/package_containment.rs` — absolute escape, `..` escape, chained
> escape, escape through a symlinked directory, and a local package held to
> the identical rule.

An absolute symlink target is refused whatever it names, the source's own
content included: the Store copies a link's target verbatim, so only a
relative link still points inside the package once copied.

> `tests/packages/containment.rs::an_absolute_symlink_into_the_source_itself_is_rejected`

A `..` that steps back out through a link is refused rather than resolved:
`s -> .` makes `s/s/../..` two levels up on disk and none on paper, and
the kernel's answer is the one a harness gets. A package file is read only
after that check, as a regular file of bounded size, so a manifest linked
to a device or a FIFO is refused rather than read forever.

> `tests/packages/containment.rs::a_link_chain_through_a_self_link_cannot_escape_the_root`
> `tests/packages/containment.rs::a_manifest_linked_outside_the_package_is_refused_before_it_is_read`

### Package discovery never follows directory symlinks

Discovery uses `symlink_metadata` and never descends into a symlink, which
makes the traversal acyclic by construction. Containment forbids leaving the
root but does not forbid a cycle inside it.

> `tests/packages/containment.rs::a_mutual_symlink_cycle_does_not_hang_discovery`
> and the self-link and ancestor-link cases beside it.

The documented cost: content reachable only through a symlinked directory is
not discovered. The symlink is still preserved as package content.

> `tests/packages/containment.rs::content_reachable_only_through_a_symlinked_directory_is_not_discovered`

Digesting walks by the same rule. `tree_sha256` runs over a freshly
materialized remote checkout before any other guard has had a say, so a link
to an ancestor would be an unbounded descent and a process abort rather than
a digest.

> `crates/uze-core/src/digest.rs::tests::a_directory_symlink_pointing_at_the_tree_itself_does_not_recurse`
> and `tests/packages/containment.rs::a_symlinked_directory_pointing_at_its_own_ancestor_does_not_hang_discovery`

A link is read, though, never merely skipped: it contributes its name and the
path it points at, so a marketplace cannot add, remove or repoint an
in-package symlink — which containment explicitly permits when relative —
behind an unchanged `integrity`. Its target is framed by a content length no
file can have, so a tree without symlinks digests to exactly the stream it
always did.

> `crates/uze-core/src/digest.rs::tests::adding_or_repointing_a_symlink_changes_the_digest`
> `crates/uze-core/src/digest.rs::tests::a_symlink_does_not_digest_as_a_file_holding_its_target`
> `crates/uze-core/src/digest.rs::tests::a_tree_without_symlinks_digests_to_its_recorded_value`

### Remote executable capabilities cross an explicit consent boundary

A remote package declaring an MCP `command` requires explicit consent before
anything is written or attached. A declarative package requires none.

> `tests/packages/acquisition.rs::a_remote_package_with_an_mcp_command_requires_trust`
> `tests/packages/acquisition.rs::a_remote_package_with_only_a_skill_requires_no_trust`
> `tests/packages/acquisition.rs::denied_trust_leaves_the_store_completely_untouched`
> `tests/packages/acquisition.rs::a_non_interactive_process_reports_trust_required_rather_than_assuming_consent`

**This is a consent boundary, not a security sandbox, and not a provenance
guarantee.** It is scoped to remote acquisition: `uze add ./local` is treated
as an operator-controlled source and asks nothing, even with an MCP server.
Cloning a repository by hand and installing the result as a local path
deliberately changes the classification of that origin. UZE does not
fingerprint downloads, mark them, track origins out of band, or persist trust
decisions — and should not be described as if it did.

> `tests/packages/acquisition.rs::a_local_package_with_an_mcp_command_still_requires_no_trust`

Consent is not inherited across an update. A revision introducing execution
the installed one did not have asks again.

> `tests/packages/acquisition.rs::an_update_introducing_executable_capability_asks_again`
> `crates/uze-core/src/package/trust.rs::a_changed_environment_or_working_directory_introduces_new_execution`

### Acquisition never executes package code

Cloning does not run hooks, does not recurse submodules, and reads
configuration from nothing but explicit flags. Capability inspection parses
declarations; it invokes nothing.

> `tests/packages/acquisition.rs::submodules_are_not_recursed_into`

### A name has one spelling, the one every harness accepts

Plugin names, marketplace names and install aliases are lowercase
kebab-case of at most 64 characters, the intersection of what every
harness accepts, so UZE never installs a name a harness refuses on
delivery, and two spellings of one name never become two packages. A
marketplace's name is held to it before anything is recorded or mirrored;
a name a person types is lowercased before it resolves.

> `crates/uze-core/src/package/store.rs::tests::a_name_is_lowercase_kebab_case_of_at_most_64_characters`
> `crates/uze-core/src/delivery/state.rs::tests::a_marketplace_named_outside_the_rule_is_never_recorded`
> `tests/cli/machine.rs::a_name_typed_in_another_case_resolves_to_the_one_on_record`

### A marketplace is named by its URL's shape, never by a machine

`git@host:owner/repo.git`, `ssh://git@host/owner/repo` and
`https://host/owner/repo.git` are one repository, recorded as
`https://host/owner/repo`; an SSH URL with a port or another user is kept
as written. The reduction reads nothing but the URL, so every machine
records the same identity and no host alias or configuration changes it —
and every comparison of two sources (registry, Store provenance, mirror,
catalogue, link, lock) goes through it, so an older spelling meets its
canonical form without a conflict.

> `crates/uze-core/src/package/acquisition/forge.rs::tests::every_spelling_of_one_repository_is_one_identity`

> `tests/packages/access.rs::an_older_spelling_meets_its_canonical_form_without_conflict_or_reclone`

### A repository is reached on one host, anonymously first

A fetch tries anonymous HTTPS, then HTTPS with the operator's credentials,
then SSH at `git@<host>:<path>.git` — the same host and path every time, so
no credential is ever offered to a host the identity does not name, and no
helper may interact. A host HTTPS cannot resolve or reach skips the other
HTTPS attempt but not SSH, whose own config may name it; offline is reported
only when nothing resolved it. A refresh nobody answers leaves the mirror's
refs and remote as they were. A short `owner/repo` resolves against
one host and is never tried on another: a forge answers a private
repository the caller cannot see exactly as it answers a missing one.

> `tests/packages/access.rs::a_short_locator_asks_one_host_and_suggests_the_others`

### One machine mutation at a time, and never two

The machine mutation guard is an `flock` on a permanent `state/mutation.lock`,
the same primitive `project::task` uses for its document. Nothing is unlinked
and no liveness is judged, so there is no window in which two acquirers both
declare a holder dead and both take the lock — the failure that let two
concurrent `uze install` runs rewrite the Store, the ledger and every harness
config at once. A holder killed outright releases it, because the kernel
closes its descriptors however it dies; the pid in the file names who is
blocking and decides nothing.

> `crates/uze-core/src/delivery/persistence.rs::tests::two_acquirers_racing_on_a_stale_lock_never_both_win`

> `crates/uze-core/src/delivery/persistence.rs::tests::a_lock_file_nobody_holds_is_not_a_lock`

### A bounded report keeps the evidence, and says what it dropped

A gate or `setup` step is capped per stream, and what is kept is the **tail**:
every runner writes its progress noise first and what failed last, so a
head-kept cap reported 64 KiB of "Compiling …" and none of the failure. What
fell off the front is counted and announced, and a stream that could not be
read at all says so rather than being reported as empty — a descendant
holding the pipe open is swept once before the reader is given up on.

> `crates/uze-core/src/machine/subprocess.rs::tests::a_failing_gate_reports_the_failure_and_not_the_progress_noise`

> `crates/uze-core/src/machine/subprocess.rs::tests::a_stream_that_could_not_be_read_says_so`

### Cache is not required for correctness

`~/.uze/cache` holds three caches, each reconstructable from a live read:
harness detection (`harness_detection.json`), attachment inspection
(`inspection.json`) and, for every marketplace registered by URL, a mirror
of its repository (`marketplaces/<name>/repo`, which remembers in
`transport.json` how it was last reached) with whatever plugins have
been asked about written out beside it (`marketplaces/<name>/plugins`).
Deleting the directory costs one probe, one inspection or one clone;
nothing installed depends on it, and no mutating path trusts it — removal
planning re-inspects live, and a mutation invalidates the entries it
touched.

The mirror is the cache tier's one piece of real machinery rather than a
copy: bare and without large blobs, it answers what a marketplace offers, at which
commit, and how far a pinned revision is behind — none of which a copied
tree can answer, and all of which cost a clone to rebuild and nothing else.
A package's bytes are never read from it: they are ingested into the Store,
which is what every harness reads and what must stand with this gone.

## Lifecycle safety (ADR-009, carried forward)

UZE never destroys external state it cannot positively identify. Drift,
conflict, and an unreadable ledger all block a destructive operation rather
than authorizing one. Every M2 addition preserved this: a failed acquisition,
a rejected package and a refused consent all mutate nothing.

### A file the operator owns keeps its link and its mode

Shell rc files, `AGENTS.md`, `agents.yaml`, `config.toml` and the harness
configs UZE merges into are written through their symlinks and keep their
permissions: a dotfiles checkout stays the file that is edited, and a
`0600` file holding a token never comes back world-readable. UZE's own
records keep the plain atomic write.

> `crates/uze-core/src/delivery/persistence.rs::a_preserving_write_goes_through_a_symlink_and_keeps_the_mode`

### A blocked mutation says so in the exit status

`Blocked` means nothing was removed or updated, so `uze remove <plugin> -m` and
`uze update -m` render the report and then exit non-zero — in both text
and JSON. A caller chaining `uze remove x -m && uze install y -m`
must not run the second half after the first did nothing.

> `tests/cli/machine.rs::a_blocked_removal_reports_and_fails`
> `tests/cli/machine.rs::a_blocked_update_reports_and_fails`

### An update that fails leaves the plugin installed

The removal is what makes an update destructive, so everything that can
refuse without needing the removed state refuses before it: re-resolving,
materializing, the trust question, and preparing the detected harnesses.
What genuinely cannot be asked first — the ingest, and the environment the
new revision composes — runs with the previous revision's bytes kept aside,
and a failure puts them back: bytes, registration and attachments, reported
as blocked. A Git- or path-sourced plugin has nothing on the machine that
would heal it otherwise.

## The command line's edges

### The updater fetches from the release page and nowhere else

`self_update` downloads a binary and renames it over the one in `PATH`, so
its download root is a constant. `UZE_BASE_URL` is `install.sh`'s testing
override and is honoured only by a debug build: were it a runtime input, an
environment variable would choose which binary a person runs from then on,
and the checksum could not tell, since `SHASUMS256.txt` comes from the same
root.

> `src/self_update.rs::tests::an_untrusted_base_url_is_ignored`

### Ordinary shell usage is never a panic

A closed pipe (`uze doctor | head -3`) ends the process at `SIGPIPE`, and an
argument that is not UTF-8 is clap's error to report — neither is an exit
101 with a panic message.

> `tests/cli/grammar.rs::a_reader_that_leaves_ends_the_command_quietly`
> `tests/cli/grammar.rs::a_non_utf8_argument_is_refused_rather_than_panicked_on`

### No credential reaches the trace

A marketplace or plugin source may carry userinfo (`https://user:token@…`),
and the command span is appended to the journal and exported over OTLP. The
argument line is redacted before it is recorded.

> `src/telemetry.rs::tests::a_credential_in_the_argument_line_never_reaches_the_trace`

---

## Prompt history (ADR-038 companion)

### A prompt is recorded only when its reconstruction is trustworthy

UZE forwards keystrokes to a PTY whose line editor it cannot observe, so the
submitted text is reconstructed client-side. Anything that could rewrite the
line invisibly — history recall, completion, an escape, a control chord —
discards the reconstruction instead of persisting a prompt the user never
typed. The history is a navigation aid, never a record of a session.

> `src/ui/orchestrator/tests.rs::prompt_buffer_tests::history_recall_discards_the_reconstruction`
> `src/ui/orchestrator/tests.rs::prompt_buffer_tests::a_control_or_alt_chord_discards_the_reconstruction`

### Prompt text is owner-only, workspace-scoped, and deletable

Each workspace keeps its own append-only file; one workspace can never evict
another's entries, the file and its directory are `0600`/`0700`, and
`prompt_history::clear` deletes a workspace's history outright.

> `crates/uze-workspace/src/prompt_history.rs::tests::history_is_owner_only`
> `crates/uze-workspace/src/prompt_history.rs::tests::each_workspace_keeps_its_own_history`
> `crates/uze-workspace/src/prompt_history.rs::tests::clear_removes_only_the_named_workspace_and_tolerates_absence`

### An agent's prompts are matched on the agent, never on its tab

The terminal runtime mints tab ids again when it restores a workspace, so a
tab id names different agents on either side of a restart. Each entry
records the agent UZE launched in the tab, and the drawer's "this agent"
listing matches on that alone.

> `src/ui/orchestrator/tests.rs::drawer_tests::an_agents_prompts_are_its_own_whatever_tab_ids_were_reused`

---

## The workspace client (ADR-038 companion)

### Nothing the workspace client draws waits on a repository

Every Git read the workspace makes — the tab strip's badge, the sidebar's
commit timeline, a commit's account, the changes overlay and its per-file
diff — runs on a thread of its own and answers through a channel. So does
placing a new agent, which is `git worktree add` plus the project's link
materialization and its `setup` command, and so is slot reconciliation,
which rewrites the task store and collects garbage.

The client used to read Git inline: `refresh_git_badge` ran inside the
`dirty` branch immediately before `terminal.draw`, and selecting a file in
the overlay loaded and highlighted its diff from the key handler. On an
ordinary repository `git status --untracked-files=all` outlasts several
frames, which made that a stalled UI by construction rather than by
accident.

Three rules hold it: the render and input halves of the client may not
name the extension host at all, nor build an application of their own
through `tui_application` — the other way into the domain, by which
finishing and discarding a preserved task ran `git worktree remove` and a
recursive directory removal on the thread that draws — and in the file
they are driven from every mention of the host is inside a
`thread::spawn`.

### An answer that arrives late is dropped, never drawn

Every background read is tagged with the question it answers — the
checkout, the commit hash, the placement the viewer was at. A read whose
question the viewer has since moved past releases its key and is
discarded; it is not wrong, it is no longer what is being asked. This is
what makes an unbounded read safe to start from a keystroke.

> `src/ui/orchestrator/tests.rs::workspace_tests::a_git_answer_for_another_checkout_is_released_and_dropped`
> `src/ui/orchestrator/tests.rs::workspace_tests::a_commit_account_arrives_only_for_the_row_last_clicked`

### Every background read answers, and the answer is what releases its key

A reservation is taken before a read starts and released when its answer
lands, so a read that ends in silence — the application would not open,
the repository was removed under the agent, the work panicked — leaves
that feature reserved for the rest of the session. Every answer therefore
carries the key it was reserved under rather than only the data it found,
every spawned read answers on every path, and the work is run so that a
panic still produces the "nothing found" answer the absorber already
draws.

> `src/ui/orchestrator/tests.rs::workspace_tests::a_terminal_runtime_that_went_away_is_said_rather_than_waited_on`

### An extension describes every surface it has, including a sidebar section

`view::View` was never the whole contract: the commit timeline was drawn
by hand from the extension's raw data, which put the palette, the eliding
and the hit rectangles on the host's side of a boundary whose whole point
is that they are not there. A section is now `view::Section`, drawn by
`extension_view::render_section` like any other extension surface, and its
hits come back as `ExtensionHit` — one variant per surface, so
"row 3 was clicked" cannot be confused between a file list and a list of
commits.

> `crates/uze-extensions/src/code/tests.rs::the_timeline_section_names_meaning_rather_than_colour`

### Slot lifecycle is the application's, not the client's

Which pane sits in which checkout is a client fact. What that *means* for
a task — that several paths of one repository reconcile once, that a
release precedes the collection acting on it, that only removals which
cannot lose work are taken, and that a directory a pane is still in is
never collected or reused whatever its record says — is domain, and a
caller getting the order wrong hands one agent's slot to another.

> `tests/acceptance/engine.rs::one_reconciliation_pass_answers_a_repository_once_however_it_is_named`
> `crates/uze-application/src/application/services/tasks/tests.rs::placement_tests::a_delivered_tasks_slot_stays_its_agents_while_a_pane_sits_in_it`

### A task document this build cannot read never stops the project

The document declares a schema version, and that version is read *before*
the document — out of the one shape every version of it shares. Every
field of a `Task` is required, so a strict parse of an older document
fails with `missing field ...` before the version guard can look at it:
the guard was dead for exactly the case it exists for, and what the
operator saw was a parse error about a file they never wrote.

A document this build cannot read — an older schema, a hand edit,
corruption — is then set aside rather than refused. It used to fail every
mutation of the project, which is every way an agent is created,
delivered or reconciled: the product was unusable in that repository with
no way back from inside it. The bytes are kept beside the document they
came from, the record starts again from empty, and the same pass adopts
every checkout Git still registers, so what is lost is UZE's own labels
and publication records and never the work.

The judgement is only ever made under the mutation lock, because that is
what separates "unreadable" from "read while somebody was publishing it".

> `crates/uze-application/src/application/services/tasks/tests.rs::task_service_tests::a_document_that_cannot_be_read_is_recovered_from_and_said`

### One task document, one writer at a time

Evaluation, delivery, placement and occupancy reconciliation are four
threads of the client, each reading the project's task document, changing
it and writing it back. The write is atomic, which is not the same as the
pair being one operation: the later writer used to erase the other's
record, so a delivered task came back `Ready` and the next tick offered to
push and open its request a second time, and a placed agent's row could
vanish while its slot stayed taken. Every mutation now runs inside
`task::locked`, which holds the document across the whole read-modify-write.

That lock is the **outer** one: everything under it speaks to Git, and Git
serializes itself under `uze_git`'s repository write lock. Nothing unbounded
belongs inside it — a placement runs the project's `setup` after the lock is
released, and a delivery runs the project's gate and its pushes between two
takes of it.

A mutation that could not be written is never reported as having happened:
a delivery carries the reason in `DeliveryReport::warnings`, and a placement
whose task could not be recorded gives the slot back and answers
`Unisolated`.

> `crates/uze-workspace/src/task.rs::tests::overlapping_mutations_do_not_erase_each_other`
> `crates/uze-application/src/application/services/tasks/tests.rs::task_service_tests::an_evaluation_that_overlaps_a_delivery_does_not_erase_it`

> `crates/uze-application/src/application/services/tasks/tests.rs::task_service_tests::a_placement_that_could_not_be_recorded_gives_the_slot_back`

### A delivery holds the document to claim its task and to record it, never while it works

A delivery runs the project's gate — thirty minutes, by its own bound —
and then a fetch, a push or a merge, none of which the document knows
anything about. Held across all of it, one delivery froze every other
mutation of every other task in the project for the full two-minute
timeout, and `flock` names no holder, so the failure could not even say
who. So the document is taken to mark the task `Integrating` and released,
and taken again to write the outcome onto the record only while it is
still the one that was claimed. `Integrating` is what the other passes
already read as "a delivery owns this": the evaluation skips it and so
does the release of abandoned tasks, so a pass that overlaps a delivery
neither reports the task as ready nor writes back the state it read before
the delivery began. The same rule covers the evaluation's one question
that leaves the machine — the `git ls-remote` behind an open request is
asked with the document unlocked and adopted under it, onto the record it
was asked about.

A delivery that could not claim its task answers with a report naming the
reason, never with nothing: an empty answer is what the client renders as
"nothing ready", which is the one thing a press on a visible, ready task
does not mean.

## Official marketplace (M3, ADR-032)

### The repository is the official marketplace

`marketplace.json` + `plugins/**` at the repo root answer "which plugins
exist, and where" — the same contract a Git or local marketplace root would
satisfy. `uze-core::acquisition::marketplace` reads that contract; it holds
no opinion on how the directory reached local disk.

> `crates/uze-core/src/acquisition/marketplace.rs` tests, notably
> `two_distinct_plugins_resolve_independently_with_no_special_casing`

### Store, Engine, Router and every Integration stay marketplace-neutral

None of them import `acquisition::marketplace` or its types.

> `tests/projection/naming.rs::store_engine_router_and_integrations_stay_marketplace_neutral`

### Adding a plugin to the marketplace needs no Rust change

Resolution is generic over plugin content: files + one `marketplace.json`
entry, nothing more.

> `crates/uze-core/src/package/acquisition/marketplace.rs::two_distinct_plugins_resolve_independently_with_no_special_casing`

### Default plugins are policy, not marketplace fact

`bootstrap::DEFAULT_PLUGIN_IDS` names which marketplace plugins install on a
fresh `UZE_HOME`; the marketplace itself may offer more.

> `crates/uze-application/src/application/tests.rs::bootstrap_installs_exactly_the_default_policy_and_is_idempotent`

### Bootstrap installs; it never silently updates

`ensure_default_plugins` — run before every CLI dispatch, including
read-only commands — only installs a default plugin that is absent. An
already-installed plugin's content is never rewritten as a side effect of a
diagnostic command.

> `crates/uze-application/src/application/tests.rs::bootstrap_never_mutates_an_already_installed_default_plugin`
> `crates/uze-application/src/application/tests.rs::read_only_bootstrap_leaves_store_state_byte_identical_on_repeat`

### A newer snapshot is reported, never silently applied

`PluginSummary::update_available` is a pure read (a scratch-directory
comparison, discarded before returning); acting on it is a separate,
explicit `update_plugin` call. Every CLI dispatch — `doctor`/`list`
included — stays on the reporting side of that line.

> `crates/uze-application/src/application/tests.rs::bootstrap_never_mutates_an_already_installed_default_plugin`

### A managed reference that resolves to nothing is adopted, not preserved

A reference occupying the name a capability needs is judged by whether it
resolves. One that resolves to nothing carries no capability into the
harness, so preserving it protects no work and blocks the attachment
permanently — which is what a UZE-owned target that moved leaves behind on
every machine that had one. Absence is the only ground: a target that
cannot be read for any other reason is preserved, because UZE cannot tell it
apart from one that resolves.

A name something else still holds stops that capability and no other. The
package is installed before delivery begins, so raising it as the command's
failure reported total failure over partial work.

> `crates/uze-core/src/delivery/exposure.rs::tests::attach_adopts_a_reference_whose_target_no_longer_exists`
> `crates/uze-core/src/delivery/exposure.rs::tests::attach_preserves_a_reference_somebody_repointed_at_their_own_content`
> `crates/uze-core/src/delivery/exposure.rs::tests::attach_preserves_a_reference_whose_target_cannot_be_read`
> `tests/projection/skill_roots.rs::a_name_somebody_else_holds_blocks_its_own_capability_and_no_other`

### A linked marketplace follows a working tree and pins nothing

A marketplace linked to a checkout on this machine is read from that
checkout: its content is what Git does not ignore — tracked, plus written
and not yet committed — so an edit reaches every harness with no commit
behind it, and an editor's temporary file never does.

`agents.lock` is not written from it. Such a package's provenance resolves
to a path rather than a commit, and recording reports that it recorded
nothing instead of failing, so a revision taken from unpublished work never
becomes a pin a collaborator cannot reach. UZE performs no Git on the
checkout: the operator's branch and uncommitted work stay theirs.

An update that takes a changed working tree into the Store says so, in
project and machine scope alike, and names the checkout: an ingest reported
as "held" left the next update calling the edit "already current".

> `tests/lifecycle/manifest_and_lock.rs::a_linked_marketplace_follows_the_checkout_and_pins_nothing`
> `tests/cli/machine.rs::a_machine_update_of_a_linked_edit_says_it_moved_from_the_working_tree`

> `crates/uze-core/src/package/acquisition/mirror.rs::linked_tests::a_file_written_and_not_yet_committed_is_package_content`

### Install reproduces a pin; only update moves one

`uze install` installs what `agents.lock` records, whatever the declared ref
points at now — that is what lets a clone reach the bytes the project was
locked at. `uze update` is the only command that moves a pin, and it
replaces rather than installs again, because the Store is idempotent by
origin and a marketplace's url and ref do not change between revisions.

A marketplace this machine cannot reach by declaration is skipped and named
rather than failing the command, so a contributor gets the half that is
reachable.

The lock is a floor, never a ceiling, because a machine holds one revision
of each plugin for every project. A machine behind the lock is raised to
it; one past it is left there and never downgraded; one whose history the
mirror cannot place against the lock's is skipped and named. The machine's
own update follows each marketplace's registered ref, never the locked
commit a reproduction left as the package's request, and a project
registering a marketplace registers its repository, not its `ref:`.

> `tests/project/consumer.rs::install_raises_the_machine_to_a_lock_that_moved_past_it`

> `tests/lifecycle/manifest_and_lock.rs::updating_a_plugin_this_project_does_not_declare_writes_nothing`

### Automatic update never asks a remote whether to act, and never grants trust

`auto_update` — the one caller of `Plugins::update` that no person typed,
run when the client opens — acts only on a package *already established* as
behind. Establishing that is a local read: the commit a package was
installed at against the head its marketplace's mirror last recorded. So no
package is ever fetched to find out whether it needs fetching, and the
CLI's read-only dispatch path, which never calls this, still reaches no
remote.

It runs under `NoTrustAuthority`, so a revision introducing executable
capability the installed one did not have is reported and left for an
explicit confirmation rather than applied.

Acquisition happens outside the mutation lock, which covers only the write:
held across a remote, one background update would refuse the operator's own
command — and every mutating action inside the client itself.

> `crates/uze-application/src/application/tests.rs::auto_update_applies_a_pending_official_snapshot_update`
> `crates/uze-application/src/application/tests.rs::auto_update_never_fetches_to_find_out_whether_there_is_an_update`

### A default plugin crossing the trust boundary is never installed silently

`PackageSource::Embedded` crosses the trust boundary like `Git`; a
non-interactive bootstrap authority (`NoTrustAuthority`) refuses rather than
granting, even for the official marketplace.

## Portable Hook delivery (ADR-033, ADR-040)

### Hook semantics are assessed per event/effect, never by event names alone

A `Stop` hook is never represented as an OpenCode tool callback and an
`ask`/`transform` effect never attaches where the target cannot preserve it;
a degraded or unsupported route states the exact loss.

> `tests/integrations/hooks.rs::compatibility_is_semantic_and_never_fabricates_a_stop_equivalence`
> `tests/integrations/hooks.rs::transform_degrades_on_every_harness_while_it_has_no_answer_channel`

### A delivered hook runs without the packager

The harness invokes a wrapper vendored in the delivered artifact, never the
`uze` binary, and nothing in that artifact names the packager. The wrapper
is a per-harness constant, owned alongside the entry that names it: written
on attach, drift-checked on inspect, removed with the last entry — and only
once nothing is left that runs it, which an unreadable ledger and a
hand-edited entry both count as. Where no
wrapper template covers the platform, nothing is attached at all (see
below).

> `tests/integrations/hooks.rs::an_unreadable_ledger_leaves_the_shared_wrapper_where_it_is`

### One vocabulary drives matchers, wrappers and handlers

Each alias names the portable fields it guarantees; each harness names the
tool it matches and the native input field each portable field is read
from. A matcher intercepts every native name its alias binds, a handler
receives the same `HOOK_*` values on every harness that delivers the hook,
and a `native:` tool yields raw input only.

> `crates/uze-integrations/src/hooks/wrapper_tests.rs::a_native_tool_the_vocabulary_does_not_bind_carries_raw_input_only`

### Hook delivery is receipt-owned and content-identity safe

Merging adds only the exact rendered entry; inspection compares that exact
content; removal refuses drift and preserves foreign hooks, plugins,
entries, and ordering — and a UZE-created file holding nothing but UZE's
own entry is cleaned up when the last entry goes. A merge into a JSON
config the *user* owns re-emits the document with their own key order
intact, so one attached hook does not reshuffle a hand-organised file.

> `crates/uze-integrations/src/shared/json_config.rs::a_merge_keeps_the_users_own_key_order`

### A package's hooks attach once per harness, idempotently

Re-attach never duplicates; an update replaces the previous version of the
same group instead of stacking it; the OpenCode bridge is package-scoped,
single-sourced (the auto-discovered global plugin directory — never a
second `plugin` config entry) and regenerates from the receipt set.

> `tests/integrations/hooks.rs::an_update_replaces_the_previous_version_of_the_samed_group`
> `tests/integrations/hooks.rs::opencode_bridge_is_package_scoped_and_regenerates_across_groups`

### The generated wrapper never silently weakens a safety hook

A handler answers with its exit code: `0` allows, `3` denies with the reason
on stderr. A failure to start, a timeout, and any other exit are fail-open
for observational hooks and fail-closed (a deny) for a declared
deny/ask/transform effect; the first deny stops later handlers, whatever
order the harness itself would have used. The wrapper's own dependency
(`jq`) follows the same rule. A deny is translated into the harness's own
blocking contract (its decision document plus exit 2 on the command-hook
harnesses) — internal exit codes never leak outward, because any other
non-zero exit is a non-blocking error there. This holds for every command
shape the ABI allows: a `sh <script> --flag` invocation, a relative path,
because a handler's `command` is a shell command line run from the package
root. Each handler is bounded by the timeout its own author declared, not by
a fixed default and not by the harness's backstop: past it the handler and
everything it started are stopped — `TERM`, then `KILL` a second later, the
second pass reaching what ignored the first — and the group's effect decides.

The same rule covers everything that decides *before* a handler runs. A
harness payload the wrapper cannot parse and a package root that is gone are
both failures resolved by the group's effect, never a quiet allowance: an
unreadable payload would leave every `HOOK_*` variable empty, so a guard
written the documented way would see nothing and allow, and a missing root
would run the author's relative commands from whatever directory the harness
happened to be in — the user's own checkout. The reason a harness is handed
is bounded, so a handler that writes megabytes to stderr is still a decision
and not a document the harness has to parse.

What the wrapper answers for every recorded fixture — the native decision
document, the exit status and the reason — is a golden per harness, taken
from the in-binary runtime that used to be the second implementation of this
contract, before it was removed (ADR-040, amended).

### The harness's own hook timeout is a backstop, never the first bound

A native entry's `timeout` is sized to outlast everything the wrapper can
spend on that group — each handler's declared deadline, the second between
`TERM` and `KILL`, and one to render the answer. A group that could outlast
it is refused at the manifest, naming the sum, rather than clamped: a hook
the harness kills is read as non-blocking, so a clamped backstop would turn
a `deny` group into an allowance.

### A hook UZE cannot deliver is never half-delivered

There is one implementation of the hook contract, and it is the generated
wrapper. A platform or harness the template does not cover gets no native
entry at all and is reported Unsupported with that reason — never an entry
pointing at a second implementation, and never a Native verdict for a
delivery that did not happen.

## Concurrent work isolation (`add-portable-worktree-policy`)

### An isolated agent gets a checkout of its own, and the primary checkout belongs to the operator

An agent isolated in a Git repository with a commit runs in a slot of its
own, created before its harness does. The primary checkout is never
assigned to an agent, so the operator's uncommitted work is exactly what
they left after any number of agents have run. Where a slot cannot be
acquired the agent is not started and the reason is said: the primary is
never a fallback.

> `crates/uze-application/src/application/services/tasks/tests.rs::placement_tests::the_first_agent_is_isolated`
> `crates/uze-application/src/application/services/tasks/tests.rs::placement_tests::three_agents_get_three_distinct_checkouts_and_none_is_the_primary`

> `src/ui/orchestrator/tests.rs::workspace_tests::an_agent_in_a_slot_is_left_unmarked_and_says_where_nowhere`

### An agent in the root never acquires a slot and never creates a branch (`add-space-kinds`)

An agent launched without isolation runs in the space's own directory, on
whatever branch it is on: no directory under `.worktrees`, no `agent/`
branch, no task. Two of them share one tree and are told apart by identity
alone. A slot asked for where none can be acquired — no repository, no
commit, the cap reached — is refused and starts nothing: the operator's
tree is never a fallback. Such an agent ends when no live tab was launched
for it, whether or not its root is a repository.

### Isolation is asked of one agent, after it is running (`add-space-kinds`)

A space is a directory and nothing more: every agent launched into one
starts where the project's `worktrees.default` says, and `Isolate` moves a
single agent into a checkout of its own without changing its identity, its
tab or its conversation. It is offered only where a slot could actually be
acquired, refused for an agent that already has one, and it may carry a
copy of the operator's uncommitted changes across — a copy, so the
operator's tree is exactly what they left.

### A checkout is a slot; a task is what comes and goes

Slots are long-lived directories named by an identifier that never changes.
A new agent takes a free slot before a directory is created: the tree is put
at the base with none of the previous task's tracked or untracked files, and
ignored artifacts survive. A slot holding work is never reused.

> `crates/uze-workspace/src/checkout/tests.rs::a_free_slot_is_reused_and_ignored_artifacts_survive`

> `crates/uze-application/src/application/services/tasks/tests.rs::placement_tests::a_delivered_tasks_slot_is_reused_by_the_next_agent`

### Work in the target is recognized by its patch, not by its commits

A forge that squashes or rebases what it merges gives the target commits of
its own, so a delivered branch stays "ahead" of it forever. Integration is
therefore read from the patch the target carries — the branch's own commits,
then the single patch a squash would have made of them — and that is what
frees a slot, prunes a branch and keeps a delivered task delivered. Read by
reachability alone, one squash merge parked a slot for the life of the
repository and every new agent paid for a checkout of its own.

> `crates/uze-workspace/src/checkout/tests.rs::a_rebase_merged_branch_frees_its_slot`

### An agent is placed on the target as the remote has it

The local target is fast-forwarded onto the remote's before a new agent's
branch is cut from it, and by nothing but a fast-forward: a target carrying
commits the remote lacks is left where it stands and the placement reports
how far behind the agent starts.

> `crates/uze-workspace/src/landing/tests.rs::the_local_target_is_fast_forwarded_onto_the_remotes`
> `crates/uze-workspace/src/landing/tests.rs::a_target_carrying_its_own_commits_is_left_alone_and_reported`
> `crates/uze-application/src/application/services/tasks/tests.rs::placement_tests::a_new_agent_starts_from_the_target_as_the_remote_has_it`

### Publication is read from the remote, never from UZE's own records

Whether a task's branch is on the remote, under which name, and how much of
it the remote already carries are read from the repository's remote-tracking
refs; the request number is asked of the remote itself. So a branch its own
agent pushed, and a request its own agent opened, count exactly as much as
ones a delivery made — the operator is a party to this, and the button has to
report the remote's state rather than UZE's history. Read from UZE's record
of its own pushes, the delivery button went on offering to send commits the
request already carried, and a delivery after an agent's own push was refused
as a non-fast-forward. The one network question — is a request open — is
asked only where the completion publishes, only for a branch that is on the
remote, at most once a minute, and never again once answered.

> `crates/uze-workspace/src/landing/tests.rs::a_branch_its_own_agent_pushed_is_published_and_in_sync`

> `crates/uze-application/src/application/services/tasks/tests.rs::task_service_tests::a_merge_project_never_measures_its_work_against_the_remote`

### Every surface reads one state, and a delivery in flight is the client's

What the branch holds and what the remote holds are folded into a single
`TaskStateView` before any surface sees it, so the sidebar mark, the header
button and the preserved list cannot disagree: a published branch level with
its request reads as `Published` everywhere, not as `Ready` in one column and
a sync in another. The exception is the delivery itself — `Integrating` is set
in memory and overwritten by the outcome before the store is saved, so no
evaluation can read it back, and the client that started the delivery is the
only party that knows one is running.

> `src/ui/orchestrator/tests.rs::workspace_tests::a_branch_level_with_its_request_reports_the_sync_instead_of_a_count`

### Only a checkout UZE recorded making is ever reset, reused or removed (`account-for-every-checkout`)

The isolation directory is shared: people, and agents giving their
subagents checkouts, add worktrees there too. So which directories are
slots is never inferred from a name or a place. A checkout UZE makes
carries a record in its own Git administrative directory, which Git
deletes with the worktree and which survives the loss of UZE's state; only
a recorded checkout under the isolation directory is reused, collected or
pruned. The slots of agents UZE launched and the `agent-<n>` of the builds
before slots are recorded on sight; an earlier build's adoption by
inference is not inherited. A record read from another checkout, or one a
newer build wrote, makes nothing reusable and is never written over.

This is what the 2026-09-26 incident broke: a subagent's checkout, seconds
old and so clean and level with the target, was adopted, read as free,
and reset under the subagent still writing in it.

### Every worktree is accounted for by owner, and a foreign one is only shown

Every worktree the repository registers is classified: an agent's slot, a
subagent's checkout, a harness's own isolation (where its integration says
that harness keeps them, under any checkout of the project), or the
operator's. Only the operator, from the checkouts view, adopts or removes a
foreign one; removal inspects first, keeps the branch, and never takes the
primary or a harness's checkout.

### A checkout somebody is working in is occupied

Any live process of the operator's whose working directory is inside a
checkout holds it, for every automatic reuse and collection and for the
operator's remove: a pane is one such process, a subagent's shell or an
editor is another. The process table is read once per decision; a process
that exits mid-read or whose directory is withheld is skipped, and a table
that cannot be read at all holds every checkout. The terminal server works
in `/`, so the checkout it was first started from is not held for its life.

### Content UZE derives never parks a checkout

Deciding whether a checkout is free or parked, a lock that only gained or
lost entries and an instruction file changed only inside UZE's managed
regions are not work: they are what a slot collects by having UZE run in
it, and each parked the slot for good. A lock that moves a plugin's pin is
work, since moving pins is what `update` exists for. Rebasing, joining and
delivering still require a tree with nothing uncommitted at all.

> `crates/uze-workspace/src/checkout/accounting_tests.rs::a_hand_edit_beside_a_region_parks_the_slot`

### The pool keeps a few spare slots and no more

At most `worktrees.spare` free slots (two by default), the most recently
used, are kept warm; every other free slot's directory is removed on the
next collection, and a free slot unused past `worktrees.idle_days` (three
by default) is removed too. Decided from the slots as they stand, with no
record of past use; branches are kept, and parked or occupied slots are
never touched.

> `crates/uze-workspace/src/checkout/accounting_tests.rs::work_is_never_trimmed`

### A subagent's checkout belongs to its agent

`uze agent work split` gives the calling agent a recorded child checkout
from the same pool, cut from its current commit; `join` replays the
child's commits onto the agent's branch and fast-forwards it, with no merge
commit and none of the agent's own commits twice. A child is held until it
is joined or its agent ends, whether or not anything is working in it; it
is never evaluated, named or delivered on its own. An agent is not
delivered while a child holds unjoined work, and one that ends with such a
child is parked with it. A parent an older build dropped is restored from
the checkout's record.

### Nothing that can hold work is removed automatically

A dirty orphan is parked with every file preserved. A branch with commits the
target lacks outlives its directory. The two automatic removals are a branch
fully reachable from the target and the directory of a free slot the pool
does not keep (below), whose branch stays.

Both removals are authorized by one predicate, and it fails closed: a
question Git could not answer — most often a `worktrees.target` this clone
does not have — is answered "not integrated", never "nothing ahead". Read
the other way, a declared target the repository lacks made every branch in
it collectable.

> `crates/uze-workspace/src/checkout/tests.rs::a_checkout_holding_work_is_parked_with_every_file_preserved`

> `crates/uze-workspace/src/checkout/tests.rs::a_target_this_clone_does_not_have_collects_nothing_and_frees_no_slot`

### Reconciliation adopts before it prunes

Checkouts nobody recorded become tasks — parked when they hold work — and a
legacy checkout keeps its branch name, since it may have been pushed. Git's
worktree registry is pruned only after every directory has been looked at, so
a stale entry can never be dropped before its work is.

> `crates/uze-workspace/src/checkout/tests.rs::prune_runs_after_adoption_and_an_orphaned_task_keeps_its_branch`
> `crates/uze-workspace/src/checkout/tests.rs::a_legacy_checkout_is_adopted_under_its_branch_name`

### A slot is invisible to the primary's own commits

The isolation directory is excluded through the repository's own
`info/exclude`, never through the operator's `.gitignore`, so the primary's
status stays what the operator left and `git add -A` there never stages a
slot as an embedded repository.

> `crates/uze-workspace/src/checkout/tests.rs::the_isolation_directory_is_excluded_without_touching_the_primary_tree`

### Task identity is immutable; the label is derived

A task's identifier keys its branch, its slot and its persisted state, and a
new label changes none of them. State lives under UZE's own `state/`, outside
every checkout, and is written atomically: a reader sees the previous
document or the new one, never a torn one.

> `crates/uze-workspace/src/task.rs::the_identifier_is_stable_while_the_label_changes`
> `crates/uze-workspace/src/task.rs::state_survives_checkout_removal`
> `crates/uze-workspace/src/task.rs::a_kill_mid_write_leaves_the_previous_or_the_new_document`

### Repository writes are serialized under one lock

Every write to a repository goes through `uze_git::write`, which takes an
inter-process lock keyed on the common directory; reads never wait for it.
A critical section re-enters its own lock, a panic releases it, and a lock
left by a dead process is reclaimed.

> `crates/uze-git/src/lib.rs::a_lock_held_by_a_dead_process_is_reclaimed`

### Readiness is a Git fact, never an announcement

A task is ready when its checkout has commits ahead of the base on a clean
tree. That is read from the checkout when the pane goes quiet or on demand,
and never from anything the agent says; a paused rebase reads as exactly
that.

> `crates/uze-workspace/src/landing/tests.rs::readiness_is_read_from_the_checkout`
> `crates/uze-workspace/src/landing/tests.rs::a_task_without_commits_is_not_delivered`
> `crates/uze-application/src/application/services/tasks/tests.rs::task_service_tests::evaluation_reads_the_checkout_and_merge_delivers`

### The target is written only in deliver, and only by UZE

Delivery rebases the task's branch inside its own checkout, runs the declared
gate on the rebased commits, and only then advances the target by
fast-forward. A conflict or a failed gate leaves the target untouched and
returns the task to the agent that owns it, with the rebase paused in its
checkout. `handoff` never touches the target; `pr` publishes against the
remote's tip and never pulls the operator's local branch.

What moves is the declared target, not whatever the primary checkout has
checked out: `git merge` advances `HEAD`, so the branch is asked for first
and the ref moved directly when the operator is standing elsewhere, and the
target's new tip is read back before the task is recorded `Integrated`.

### A delivery never collides with the operator's own edits

A fast-forward into the checked-out target updates the operator's working
tree, so a task touching a file the operator has uncommitted changes to is
refused before anything is written.

> `crates/uze-workspace/src/landing/tests.rs::overlap_with_the_operators_uncommitted_work_refuses_and_writes_nothing`

### Sibling tasks share work only through the target

The second task delivered is rebased onto a target that already contains the
first; a live, clean task follows a moved target on its own, and one mid-edit
is never rebased under its agent. No task's branch ever carries another
task's commits directly.

> `crates/uze-application/src/application/services/tasks/tests.rs::task_service_tests::evaluation_lets_a_clean_task_follow_the_target`

### A linked file is ignored by the repository

A path in `worktrees.link` must be relative, stay inside the repository and
be ignored by it; a violation is a malformed lock at read time, not a
surprise at launch. Linked or not, a failed `setup` warns and never blocks a
launch.

> `crates/uze-workspace/src/declaration.rs::a_link_escaping_the_repository_is_rejected`

> `crates/uze-workspace/src/checkout/tests.rs::a_failing_setup_warns_with_its_last_line_and_a_passing_one_is_silent`

### The projection never triggers a harness's own isolation

The text projected into the shared baseline states where the reader already
is and how to isolate a subagent; it never asks for a top-level worktree. A
harness with its own worktree primitive activates on exactly that
instruction, and would isolate a second time on top of the slot UZE already
placed the agent in.

> `tests/projection/worktree_policy.rs::the_projection_never_triggers_a_harnesss_own_isolation`
> `crates/uze-workspace/src/worktree.rs::the_projected_text_never_asks_for_a_top_level_worktree`

### A declaration stays editable

The region's identity carries the rendered content's digest, so changing the
lock reads as one region going stale and another appearing — never as drift
inside the region that already exists. Exactly one policy region exists at a
time, and a hand edit still drifts and is refused.

> `tests/projection/worktree_policy.rs::editing_the_declaration_replaces_its_region_rather_than_drifting`
> `tests/projection/worktree_policy.rs::an_edited_region_is_blocked_not_overwritten`

### A change view shows one checkout, never the repository

The code surface is scoped to the checkout the active tab is in, and
resolves every `git` call against it. `git worktree list` answers
repository-wide from anywhere inside the repository, so listing linked
worktrees would put the operator's diff and every sibling agent's — including
slots whose agent is long gone — inside a tab that owns exactly one of them.

> `crates/uze-extensions/src/code/changes.rs::repository_tests::discovers_main_and_configured_linked_worktrees`

### An unknown lock field is rejected, never silently dropped

A key `ProjectLock` does not understand is refused at every level.
Tolerating one for forward compatibility buys nothing here: the
`version` field already says whether this UZE can read the file, and a lock is
regenerated rather than preserved. `WorktreePolicy` denies unknown fields for
the opposite reason — everything a project may declare about isolation is
already named there. Both halves say the same thing: a declared policy can
never become no policy in silence.

## Terminal runtime (`add-terminal-runtime`)

### One server per user; a space has a root

The terminal server is one per `UZE_HOME`, and every client attaches to it
whatever directory it was started in. A space is born from a root: starting
`uze` in a directory somebody chose selects the space rooted at its
workspace root, opening one when no space has that root. Behaviour derives
from the root; there is no global space.

### One pane that stops reading never holds up the others

Writing into a pane blocks for as long as its program does not read, so
the map every pane's input, output, resize and damage goes through is
released before any PTY is written: a paste into a stopped program costs
that pane alone. Each pane's diff and send are one step under its own
baseline, so two threads never store an older picture over a newer one.

### Where a client lands and what that may create are two questions

An attach says one of three things: take the session as it stands, land on
the space at this seat *if there is one*, or open a space at this seat. Only
the third creates. This is what makes closing a space stick — a seat that
always created meant the directory a client started in was a standing
request, so a space closed on purpose came back when the runtime went away
mid-run, and again on the next launch from that directory. A close that does
not stay closed is indistinguishable from a close that did not work.

The home directory is the seat nobody chose: a shell starts there, so
starting `uze` there lands on the home space when one is open and adds
nothing when none is. A home space someone creates deliberately is still
theirs, and still what the next launch from home lands on.

> `src/ui/orchestrator/tests.rs::starting_at_home_lands_in_the_workspace_rather_than_adding_to_it`

### Focus is per client

Which space and tab a client looks at is the client's own; the session it
receives carries its selection overlaid on the shared structure, and another
client's selection never moves it.

> `crates/uze-terminal/src/runtime/tests.rs::a_clients_view_overlays_its_own_selection_and_heals_a_stale_one`
> `tests/acceptance/engine.rs::two_clients_keep_their_own_focus_and_a_nested_launch_opens_a_space`

### A launch inside a pane opens a space, never a client

Every pane carries `UZE_PANE`; a `uze` that finds it asks the running server
for a space at its workspace root and exits, so a client is never opened
inside a client.

> `tests/acceptance/engine.rs::two_clients_keep_their_own_focus_and_a_nested_launch_opens_a_space`

### Every question the kernel answers is asked in one place

Four facts about a process the runtime did not spawn — who is on the other
end of a socket, what image a pid runs, where it is standing, what it
inherited — come only from the kernel, and each platform exposes them
differently (`/proc` on Linux, `libproc`/`sysctl` on macOS).
`process_probe` holds every one of those readings; the decisions built on
them are written once and run unchanged everywhere.

The rule this enforces is that `None` means *unknown*, never *no*. A probe
that cannot answer must not be read as a negative answer — the endpoint keeps
the state it had rather than tearing down a healthy server, and a pane
reports no foreground status rather than an invented one.

Adding a platform means teaching `uze_platform::probe`, never widening a
`cfg` at a call site.

### Nothing a peer sends is acted on before it is bounded

A frame's length prefix is refused before it is allocated, and the same
bound holds on the way out, so the two sides cannot disagree about what is
sendable; the bound is derived from the largest thing the protocol
legitimately carries — a full repaint of the largest pane it allows. Pane
dimensions are bounded at the edge that receives them and again where a
pane is created, because `Term::resize` allocates a cell per position and
clamps nothing of its own. Nothing the server sends may be larger than that
one pane, so a whole-workspace repaint goes out one frame per pane rather
than one frame carrying them all. The *first* frame from a peer nothing has
vouched for is held to a smaller bound still — what a handshake actually
says — and to one deadline over the whole handshake rather than one per
read, which `SO_RCVTIMEO` alone cannot express.

### A client is told the runtime went away, never left looking at it

A frame that cannot be written ends the connection — both halves — rather
than only the thread that tried to write it, so the peer reads EOF and runs
its disconnected path instead of sitting on chrome that still looks live
while events it will never see pile up behind it. And `stop` is heard as a
first frame, by a server no client has ever attached to: since the
workspace claim makes a survivor refuse every replacement, that request is
the only way back in short of a manual `kill`.

> `crates/uze-terminal/src/runtime/tests.rs::a_client_an_event_cannot_reach_is_disconnected_rather_than_frozen`

> `src/ui/orchestrator/tests.rs::workspace_tests::a_terminal_runtime_that_went_away_is_said_rather_than_waited_on`

### Liveness is the workspace claim; the kernel names the peer

Whether a server is alive is answered by the workspace claim alone, never by
a file in the runtime directory: the kernel releases the claim when its
holder dies however it dies, so a crashed server — a zombie nobody reaped
included — holds nothing. A client asks for the claim shared and a server
takes it exclusively, so a server starting while a client asks is never
refused as though it had met another server. Only the server holding the
claim unlinks the endpoint, binding over whatever it finds there; a client
never does, so a listener nobody can vouch for — every listener, where the
process table cannot be read — is connected to rather than taken down. A
process is signalled on one of two proofs, never on a claim alone. The
kernel names it as the socket's peer (`SO_PEERCRED`, which nothing can
forge) and the process table says, right before the signal, that it runs
`uze` — of another build and unable to answer this build's handshake, or
any `uze` at all, when the claim is free and it is serving a workspace
deleted under it. Or the claim itself records it: a
server writes its own pid into the claim it holds, which is what makes a
server at an endpoint this build cannot compute something `stop` can stop
and `attach` can replace rather than a workspace shut until the machine
restarts. That record is a lead, not the proof — it is corroborated
against the process table before the signal, exactly as the peer is, and
a claim that records nobody is reported rather than guessed at. A pid that
does not name exactly one process is never signalled: `kill(-1, …)` is every
process the user owns. The directory the endpoint lives in is proved to be
this user's own, unreachable by anyone else, and not a symlink, before a
socket carrying every pane's contents is put in it.

### A live server is ended only when it cannot serve the client that found it

The image a server was started from says which binary it came from and
nothing about what it speaks, so it never decides on its own that a server
must go: a `make install` over a running one — the ordinary state of this
repository's own development — leaves every later `uze` looking at "another
build" that is usually carrying the very same protocol. A server of another
build is asked instead, with this build's own handshake and inside a bound:
one that answers with a snapshot is attached to, and the panes it is
running go on running. Only silence, a refusal, a hang-up or bytes this
build cannot read — what a server built to another framing answers — costs
it the workspace, and the panes it held are restored from the persisted
workspace by the server that replaces it.

> `crates/uze-terminal/src/runtime/tests.rs::a_second_client_attaches_to_a_live_server_of_another_build`
> `crates/uze-terminal/src/runtime/tests.rs::a_server_that_answers_this_builds_handshake_serves_it`

> `crates/uze-terminal/src/runtime/tests.rs::an_attach_replaces_only_a_server_it_can_name`

### One workspace, one server

A server holds an advisory claim on the persisted workspace for as long as
it exists, taken beside the workspace under `$UZE_HOME` rather than in the
runtime directory a `/tmp` cleaner can take away. A second server refuses to
restore a workspace another live one holds, so an endpoint that vanishes
under a running server can never turn one set of agents into two — and the
server that holds it puts itself back at the endpoint instead, under the
same flag the shutdown takes, so the two orderings are the only two there
are. Only a lock another process actually holds reads as contention: a
filesystem that cannot lock at all surfaces as the I/O failure it is,
rather than as a server to go and stop that does not exist.

> `crates/uze-terminal/src/runtime/tests.rs::only_a_held_lock_reads_as_another_server`

### A pane's identity is its own

A pane's environment carries only what that pane's launch put there, and a
shim identity stamp is read only from the process it was stamped for.
Without both, every plain shell under a `uze` started inside a shimmed agent
reported as that agent, persisted as one, and was relaunched as one.

## Agent session continuity (`add-agent-session-continuity`)

### A conversation belongs to a task, never to a directory

What an agent resumes is recorded against the task, in UZE's own state
outside every checkout. A slot reset keeps it, a slot recycled for the next
task never inherits it, and a task given its checkout back finds what it
left.

> `crates/uze-workspace/src/conversation.rs::a_recycled_slots_new_task_finds_nothing_the_previous_one_left`
> `crates/uze-workspace/src/conversation.rs::a_verified_claim_resolves_to_its_own_record_wherever_inside_its_directory`

### An agent is what its launch carried, verified twice (`identify-agents-at-launch`)

Which agent a process is comes from the identity its launch stamped into
the pane's environment — persisted with the tab, respawned with it, echoed
back to the client — and never from the directory it stands in. Every
reader verifies the stamp twice before acting on it: the project's records
name it, and the directory is the one the record gives that agent. An
identifier nobody recorded, or one claimed from outside its own directory,
is no identity at all; two records over one directory are told apart by
the identifier alone. The name of the variable has one owner, the terminal
runtime's launch vocabulary, and core never spells it.

> `crates/uze-terminal/src/runtime/tests.rs::a_launch_environment_reaches_the_first_process`
> `crates/uze-terminal/src/runtime/tests.rs::a_launch_environment_survives_a_restart`

> `tests/acceptance/session_continuity.rs::an_identity_claimed_from_the_wrong_directory_is_launched_untouched`

Reading back which conversation an agent moved to is held to the same
rule. Agents sharing a directory each see the others' conversations as the
newest one there, so a read-back never adopts a conversation another agent
of the project already holds.

> `crates/uze-workspace/src/continuity.rs::a_conversation_another_agent_holds_is_never_taken_over`
> `crates/uze-integrations/src/claude/session.rs::a_conversation_another_agent_holds_is_never_adopted`
> `tests/architecture/layering.rs::architecture_rules_hold` (the identity variable has one owner)

### An identity has an owner, and a launch inside a launch is ordinary

The shim that first reads an identity with no owner takes it, stamping its
own pid; a shim that finds the identity owned by another pid is running
inside that owner's launch — a harness started by a harness — and treats
it as absent. Two processes never share one resume. The agent's own
commands are the owner's children and accept the inherited identity
without applying the rule: a command is not a launch.

> `tests/acceptance/agent_surface.rs::an_agent_names_its_work_through_the_real_binary`

### A relaunch resumes; the decision is made where every relaunch passes

Resume-or-start is decided inside the launched process, on the launch
boundary — the only place the terminal runtime's own restore reaches, with
no client present. A first launch names or records the conversation; the
next one continues it.

> `tests/acceptance/session_continuity.rs::a_relaunched_agent_resumes_the_conversation_its_task_was_left_in`
> `crates/uze-workspace/src/continuity.rs::a_second_launch_resumes_what_the_first_recorded`

### Continuity never rewrites an invocation and never blocks a launch

An invocation carrying anything of the operator's own is launched exactly as
typed, a launch carrying no identity is untouched wherever it is made — a
managed task's checkout included, because a person typing there is not the
launch UZE composed — and every failure — a conversation the harness no
longer holds, unreadable state, a harness that declares no mechanism —
starts the agent anyway.

> `tests/acceptance/session_continuity.rs::an_invocation_the_operator_composed_is_launched_exactly_as_typed`

> `crates/uze-workspace/src/continuity.rs::unreadable_state_still_launches_the_agent`

### The record follows the agent, not the assignment

An identifier written once at launch goes stale the moment the person
clears, forks or switches the conversation. What is recorded is the last one
observed for the task, so what resumes is where the work was left.

> `crates/uze-workspace/src/continuity.rs::a_conversation_the_agent_moved_to_replaces_the_one_it_started_in`
> `crates/uze-workspace/src/conversation.rs::an_answer_to_a_replaced_launch_is_dropped`

### Continuity is declared per harness, and the matrix is derived from it

A harness says whether UZE may name its conversation, must read the name
back, or has no mechanism at all; the default is none, so a harness nobody
has looked into contributes no argument and reports no conversation. The
published matrix reads that declaration rather than restating it.

## What UZE persists (`redesign-persisted-state`)

### A record written in a shape this build knows is carried across, silently

Carrying a record across a version is the product working, not an event.
What a version change means is written once, as a step from one shape to
the next, where the next record can reach it — a release that moved three
shapes at once cost an operator every space they had open over a
difference of one field, because there was nowhere to say what the
difference meant.

> `crates/uze-document/src/lib.rs::tests::an_older_shape_climbs_every_rung_in_order`
> `crates/uze-document/src/lib.rs::tests::a_record_with_no_version_at_all_is_the_first_shape`
> `crates/uze-terminal/src/runtime/tests.rs::a_workspace_from_the_previous_release_is_carried_across_rather_than_set_aside`

### A record from a newer build is never taken

Two builds on one machine is the ordinary state of this repository. A rule
without a direction has them taking turns destroying each other's records,
each saying it had recovered — so a shape ahead of this build is left
exactly as it is, and the operation that needed it is refused.

> `crates/uze-document/src/lib.rs::tests::two_builds_run_alternately_never_destroy_each_others_records`
> `crates/uze-terminal/src/runtime/tests.rs::a_workspace_from_a_newer_build_is_left_exactly_as_it_is`

### What could not be carried is kept, and reaches the operator

A record UZE cannot read is moved aside rather than deleted, under a name
nothing reads as a record — and said, wherever the operator is. The
terminal runtime is a different process from the screen, so it holds what
it could not carry until a client is there to be told; a log that is off
unless `UZE_LOG` is set is not somewhere an operator looks.

> `crates/uze-core/src/delivery/leftovers.rs::tests::every_set_aside_record_is_found_wherever_it_was_kept`

### The tier a thing sits in is what deleting it costs

Records are what UZE was told or decided, and nothing else on the machine
knows them. Everything else is observation: produced again, or observed
again. A thing must not sit in a tier that claims a different cost than it
has — generated harness content sat one letter from the ledger that
describes it, authoritative-looking and entirely reproducible.

> `crates/uze-core/src/machine/home.rs::tests::nothing_a_record_needs_sits_in_a_tier_that_can_be_deleted`
> `crates/uze-core/src/machine/harness_runtime.rs::tests::the_sweep_keeps_the_tenants_and_nothing_else`

### Every path UZE owns is named in one place

A path composed where it happens to be used is one nothing can enumerate,
and a sweep of what UZE persists — or a rule every document inherits — can
only exist if one place knows them all.

> `tests/architecture/layering.rs::every_path_uze_owns_is_named_in_the_map`

### A project's records are one directory that names its own root

The project id is a one-way hash. It keyed four directories and only one of
them recorded what it meant, so the records could be enumerated and none of
them resolved. One directory, with the root in it, is what makes a
machine-wide sweep possible at all — and makes forgetting a project one
removal.

> `crates/uze-core/src/project/record.rs::tests::the_previous_layouts_records_are_carried_into_the_directory`

### Where the work stands belongs to the agent, and to the checkout it is in

Every agent reads where the work in its checkout stands, whether or not
that checkout was cut for it. An isolated agent has one to itself, so the
answer is its own; agents sharing the project's root all read the same
one, which is the truth about where they are. Only *delivering* is
withheld from them: the branch is the operator's, UZE did not cut it, and
rebasing and pushing it is theirs to ask for.

### Preserved work answers for the machine, and resumes into its own project

Work is bound to a project and never to a space: an agent's record carries
a base, a branch, a checkout and a target, and nothing about a space. So
the space it was left in can be closed and another opened on the same
directory under another name, and the work still lands in it.

## Runtime projection lifecycle (ADR-014)

### A projection belongs to a project root, and no two share one

Each project root gets its own runtime directory, keyed by its canonical
path. A worktree is a root of its own, so a branch's `AGENTS.md` and Skills
never reach a session working on another — and two sessions on the *same*
root compute the same directory and the same content, so there is nothing to
coordinate between them.

> `crates/uze-integrations/src/claude/runtime.rs::runtime_projection_tests::repeated_projection_for_the_same_project_is_idempotent`
> `crates/uze-integrations/src/claude/runtime.rs::runtime_projection_tests::concurrent_projection_calls_never_degrade_to_passthrough`
> `tests/integrations/runtime_projection.rs::a_destroyed_checkout_loses_its_projection_and_its_repository_keeps_one`

### A projection outlives its project only until the next sweep

Every project's runtime directory records the canonical root it was built
for, and a sweep removes each one whose root is gone — the checkout of a
delivered agent, a worktree deleted by hand, a project moved. Existence of
the root is the only criterion: a projection already current is skipped
rather than rewritten, so mtime says when the project last changed, not when
it was last used, and an age rule would collect exactly the projections that
work. A directory naming no root it can be identified by is swept on the
same terms, and rebuilt by the next launch that needs it.

> `tests/integrations/runtime_projection.rs::a_swept_projection_is_rebuilt_by_the_next_launch`

### The runtime tree has two tenants, and the sweep owns the rest

`runtime/projects/` holds derived projections that outlive every invocation
and die with their project root. `runtime/attachments/` holds what UZE
generates for a harness to read, whose lifetime is the attachment's rather
than any project's — the receipt ledger is what answers for it. Anything
else directly under `runtime/` is UZE's own output at a path nothing writes
any more, so the sweep removes it, and nothing project-owned is reached
through a projection it collects.

## Module boundary (`separate-package-manager-and-workspace`)

### The package manager never depends on the workspace

The workspace's domain is `uze-workspace`, above `uze-core`; `uze-core`
does not depend on it, so the compiler refuses a package-manager module
that names a task, a checkout or a policy. In `uze-application`, which
orchestrates both, the package manager's files and the shared ones are
listed and held to the same rule by a test.

> `tests/architecture/layering.rs::the_package_manager_never_names_the_workspace`

### A workspace setting never fails a package command

`agents.yaml`'s `worktrees` and `artifacts` sections are carried unread by
the manifest and parsed by the workspace, which also owns the `worktrees.link`
Git check. A section the workspace would reject still leaves `install` and
`status` able to read the file.

> `crates/uze-workspace/src/declaration.rs::tests::a_workspace_section_the_workspace_rejects_does_not_fail_the_manifest`
> `tests/lifecycle/manifest_and_lock.rs::a_typo_in_the_manifest_is_named_rather_than_ignored`

### A project declares a policy only by choosing one

The `agents.yaml` UZE creates carries `worktrees:` empty over commented
choices, so it declares nothing; choosing one writes it beneath that key.

> `crates/uze-workspace/src/declaration.rs::tests::a_scaffolded_manifest_declares_no_policy`
> `crates/uze-workspace/src/declaration.rs::tests::choosing_a_completion_writes_it_under_the_scaffolds_empty_key`

### Each region of `AGENTS.md` has one owner

The package manager writes its regions (plugin contributions, plugin
authoring) and counts only those as drift; it never writes, removes or
counts the workspace's region. The workspace keeps its own in step in the
primary checkout only, never in a slot, and an isolate does not carry a
region-only change. Both owners take one per-project guard on the file.

### No shell file is edited, and the shim is the workspace's

`uze setup` creates the shims and never writes a shell startup file. The
terminal server puts the shims first on every pane's `PATH`, and no command
walks the operator's `PATH` to ask about a shim.

## Architecture seams (`enforce-architecture-seams`)

### The layer direction is a fact, not a convention

No presentation file names `uze_core::` or `uze_integrations`: the CLI and
the TUI consume `uze-application` and nothing below it. The budget that
carried the transition is empty; what remains is `sanctioned` and named —
the runtime shim and the harness matrix, which share the binary crate but
are separate entry points that report on the domain rather than present
it.

> `tests/architecture/layering.rs::architecture_rules_hold`

### Appearance is data, and one vocabulary is the only way to name it

Nothing UZE draws carries a colour value or a glyph of its own. A surface
names what it *is* — a `uze_theme::Token`, a `uze_theme::Symbol` — and the
active theme decides what that looks like, so the TUI's chrome, the CLI's
output, a pane's default and indexed colours, and the palette syntax
highlighting is rendered with cannot drift apart the way four hand-kept
copies of one palette always did. Two adapters translate the vocabulary
into what each surface draws with (ratatui, anstyle) and are the only
places allowed to construct a colour; a colour that genuinely came from
content rather than from the design system passes through
`theme::content`, named so it cannot be mistaken for chrome.

A theme is a file, and a partial one is a whole one. Appearance resolves
as a stack — the built-in default, then the selected glyph set, then any
theme a theme is a variation of, then the theme, then the operator's own
overrides — and merging happens between *declarations* at every level,
never between resolved colours. That is what keeps an ancestor's references alive: repaint the
accent in a variation and everything two layers down written `@accent`
follows. Surfaces and borders are declared as a separation from the
theme's own background rather than as the value they resolve to, which is
what lets a background declaration alone carry a light theme.

The palette and the glyph set are two selections, not one, because they
are facts of different kinds: which marks a terminal can draw belongs to
the font someone installed, and a palette belongs to this afternoon.
Neither selection reads or writes the other's half. And UZE never infers
the set — no terminal can be asked which font it renders with, so the
choice is made by looking at each set drawn in its own glyphs.

UZE's own themes and glyph sets carry no emoji — an emoji is a different
font family, a width that varies by terminal, and a picture that ignores
the hue carrying the meaning. Colours bound to a hue by contract are the one thing that does
not follow a meaning: the sixteen a program inside a pane names by index are literal,
because index 2 is *green* to whatever emitted it.

### An extension describes; the host draws

An extension answers with a `view::View` and never receives a frame,
computes a rectangle, or names a colour. The host resolves semantic roles
against the one palette, wraps the content, and derives every click target
from what it actually drew — so layout has a single owner rather than two
sides computing the same geometry. Syntax highlighting is the one thing
that travels as colour, because it comes from a theme the extension ships
rather than from the host's design system.

> `src/ui/extension_view/tests.rs::a_click_target_comes_from_what_the_host_drew`
> `src/ui/extension_view/tests.rs::chrome_uses_the_hosts_palette_and_content_keeps_its_own`
> `crates/uze-extensions/src/code/tests.rs::the_view_names_meaning_rather_than_colour`

### An extension reaches nothing it was not handed

No `UzeHome`, no Store, no receipts, no `uze-application` — and no process,
no filesystem, no environment. Everything outside the extension's own
memory arrives through `uze_extensions::Host`, which the workspace client
implements in one named place.

An extension is code UZE runs in its own process, a different trust class
from plugin bytes a harness reads. Being a pure function of what it is
handed is what makes that tractable: a capability the host never granted is
one it can withhold, and a sandbox is a property of the loading mechanism
rather than something added afterwards. A `&mut Frame` could not cross a
process boundary; neither can a `fork()`.

The grant is no longer read-only — the file explorer saves and deletes —
and that is exactly why it is worth stating where the writing happens.
`Host::write_file` refuses a path that is not already a file, so a save
can only ever mean "save this file" and never "create whatever this string
names"; `Host::delete_file` refuses a directory, because a recursive
removal is a different act from the one a single keystroke describes. Both
live in `src/ui/extension_host.rs` and nowhere else.

> `tests/architecture/layering.rs::architecture_rules_hold`
> `src/ui/extension_host.rs::the_write_grant_is_narrower_than_the_filesystem`

### Git's exit code is reported, never classified by the transport

`uze-git` hands back what Git said. What a non-zero exit *means* is a
property of the subcommand — `diff` reporting differences, `rebase`
reporting a conflict, `rev-parse --verify` reporting a missing ref — and
flattening that into one error is how two callers ended up with two
incompatible conventions over the same binary. Reads and writes are
separate entry points so a repository write lock has one place to live,
and so a status view never blocks behind one.

> `crates/uze-git/src/lib.rs::a_non_zero_exit_is_reported_not_flattened_into_an_error`

### Git is spawned in exactly two places, for two different threat models

`uze-git` drives the operator's own checkout, so their configuration
applies. `acquisition::git` clones untrusted remote repositories, so it
strips all Git configuration instead — `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM`,
`GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null`, hooks disabled, no submodules, no prompt,
SSH in batch mode refusing an unknown host key. What it admits is named:
the operator's network (proxy, certificate authority) on every attempt,
and on an authenticated one their environment minus `GIT_*` and their
`credential.*` settings with their URL scopes, replayed through
`GIT_CONFIG_COUNT` so nothing secret reaches argv; the authenticated HTTPS
attempt follows no redirect, and the anonymous one has no `HOME`, so no
`.netrc`. Plain HTTP reaches only loopback. Merging the two spawns would be
wrong in both directions; a third is what the rule prevents.

> `crates/uze-core/src/package/acquisition/git.rs::tests::the_operators_network_and_credentials_are_read_with_their_scopes`

### No command ships without a performance decision

The leaf list is derived from `clap`'s own grammar rather than maintained
beside it, and checked both ways: a command added without a
`PerformanceClass` fails by name, and a classification for a command that
no longer exists fails by name. Verified by adding each in turn and
watching the test refuse.

> `src/command_performance.rs::every_cli_command_is_classified`
> `src/command_performance.rs::every_named_performance_test_exists`

### Every budgeted path is timed on its own, in a world where a probe shows

Each `Budgeted` command's application call is timed on a fresh
application — no in-process memo, only what is on disk — against a
harness that sleeps half a second per detection probe and a marketplace
whose repository was deleted after registration. The ceiling is 25 ms,
best of three, in a debug build: half of what the spec promises a person
on a release build, set where a regression shows. The bootstrap that
precedes every command is held to the same ceiling and to a second claim
a clock cannot make: run warm, it leaves every file under `UZE_HOME` as it
found it.

> `crates/uze-application/tests/performance.rs`
> `tests/cli/budget.rs::a_warm_read_only_command_writes_nothing_under_uze_home`

### A marketplace listing never clones

What a marketplace registered by URL offers is answered from a cached
checkout, filled by the clone `market add` already makes and refilled at
most once an hour; the repository can be unreachable, or gone, and the
listing, the plugin picker and a plugin's inspection still answer. A
local marketplace is read where it is, every time.

> `tests/cli/budget.rs::a_marketplace_registered_by_url_is_listed_without_its_repository`
> `crates/uze-application/tests/performance.rs::market_list_and_inspect_meet_the_budget_without_the_repository`
> `crates/uze-application/src/application/marketplace_catalogue.rs::tests::a_local_marketplace_is_read_where_it_is`

### Every action is one trace, and every entry point is a span

A command, a key in the TUI and a shim launch each open a root span;
every public method of an application service opens one under it, named
for what the person asked, with the id or path it acts on and the error
when it fails; every process UZE runs — Git, a clone, a vendor CLI, a
provisioning installer, a hook handler — is a span with how it ended. A
TUI worker thread enters the span that started it, so what a key caused
stays under the key. Held by a scan, not by memory: an entry point added
without `#[tracing::instrument]` fails by name.

> `tests/architecture/instrumentation.rs::every_application_entry_point_is_a_span`
> `crates/uze-application/src/application/tracing_tests.rs::a_service_call_is_one_span_tree`
> `crates/uze-git/src/lib.rs::tests::every_invocation_is_a_span_with_its_exit_code`

### A harness lives on this machine's filesystems

Resolving a harness executable — for detection, its fingerprint, the
runtime shim and the check that the shim is first — skips `PATH` entries
on a `9p` mount, the filesystem a Windows drive is inside WSL. A stat
there is a network round trip, a `PATH` inherited from Windows carries a
dozen of them, and a harness UZE integrates keeps its state under `$HOME`
on this side.

> `crates/uze-core/src/machine/harness_runtime.rs::tests::a_windows_drive_mounted_into_wsl_is_not_where_a_harness_is_looked_for`

## Harness conformance (`assert-one-capability-contract`)

### Every harness answers the same questions

A capability contract states an outcome and names no vendor; a harness's
bindings say how that harness is driven and carry no assertion. The
contract runs identically against all four, so a check can no longer live
in one vertical with nothing to disagree with it — which is how a Skill
that never reached the model read as an invocation policy working, on
three harnesses, for months.

> `conformance/contract/skill.py`
> `conformance/contract/mcp.py`

### A harness declines out loud, or not at all

A harness that cannot deliver part of a contract returns a reason from
`bindings.unsupported`, and the run records it beside the passes. Omitting
the check is not available: an omission cannot be reviewed, and the
divergence it hides is exactly what the Lab exists to surface.

This is how the suite now states that `invoke.user: false` is enforced on
one harness of four — a fact no vertical asked about before.

> `conformance/contract/skill.py::_declined`

### An absence proves nothing until something proves the surface

Every absence assertion in a contract is gated on a presence assertion.
"the policy hid it" and "the surface was empty" are the same observation
otherwise. `check_absence` already refuses an unsettled turn (ADR-035);
this is the other half of the same defence.

> `conformance/contract/skill.py::_assert_catalog`

## Unfinished surfaces

### What a person downloads carries no half-built screen

A surface the product has not committed to is named in
`uze_core::features`: off in a release build, on in a development one, and
overridable either way by `UZE_FEATURES`. Resolved at runtime rather than
through a Cargo feature, because the vocabularies it gates (a route, a
scope, an action) are exhaustive enums that tests walk, and a build that
stopped compiling the hidden code would stop testing it — a flag whose
purpose is to defer a decision must not delete the evidence that decision
needs.

> `uze-core::machine::features::tests::what_a_person_downloads_carries_no_unfinished_surface`
> `uze-core::machine::features::tests::the_environment_answers_either_way`

### A screen behind a feature is absent or whole

The sidebar, the walk from one screen to the next, the id a layout file
remembers and the Shortcuts screen that documents a surface all read the
same list. A build where three of them agree and the fourth still offers a
way in is the failure mode a runtime flag has in place of a compile error,
so it is the one this guards.

> `src/ui/tests.rs::a_screen_behind_a_feature_is_absent_or_whole`

## Decisions deliberately *not* taken

Recorded because absence is a decision, and because each one has been proposed
and set aside for a reason rather than forgotten.

| Not built | Why not, for now |
|---|---|
| third-party marketplace hosting | UZE's own official marketplace (M3) is a discovery/acquisition contract over its own repository; hosting *other* publishers' marketplaces is a different product |
| remote registry | nothing to serve until acquisition is dogfooded; M3's `marketplace.json` contract is shaped to allow a remote source later without touching Store/Engine/Integration |
| cache | correctness first; a cache is an optimization with a second-source-of-truth risk |
| content-addressable store | a Git commit is already a content identity, and a local path has no reproducibility to protect |
| lockfile | meaningful only with dependencies between packages, which do not exist |
| GitHub-specific source | a host is a URL; the mechanism is Git |
| automatic update | requires update semantics to be exercised by hand first |
| persistent trust database | one consent boundary, not a permission system |
| network-dependent gating test | local bare repositories prove the mechanism; a public repo would test that provider's availability |
| remote marketplace search | only one marketplace (embedded, official) exists; nothing to search yet |
| a registry-driven CLI grammar | a feature cannot contribute a command today: `Command` is a closed `clap` derive. Building it dynamically instead would rewrite a 2400-line dispatch and trade `clap`'s typed parsing for a builder — to serve an author who does not exist yet. What already holds is the part that mattered: the leaf list is derived from the real grammar, so a command added without a `PerformanceClass` fails by name, and a stale entry fails by name too. Revisit when something outside `main.rs` actually needs to register a command — an installable extension, or a second binary sharing the grammar |
| installable extensions | the TUI's Extensions screen catalogs bundled, compiled-in extensions (`ExtensionRegistry::builtin`); loading/enablement of user-installed extensions is not built |
| plugin version resolver | `plugin.json` carries no version field yet; nothing depends on one |
| marketplace federation | one official marketplace; combining several is unproven need |
| Git sparse checkout for marketplace sources | the `marketplace.json` contract is shaped to allow acquiring only a resolved plugin's subtree later; not implemented |
| reverse/foreign harness-format import | the acquisition contract is canonical `plugin.json` only (M2); a foreign-format importer (`ClaudePluginImporter`) existed as dead, unreachable code and was removed (ADR-005) — foreign import staying structurally separate from harness delivery is still the intended shape if it returns, but nothing is retained in production speculatively |

### The name is asked for as the agent's first action

The projected region's first bullet is the naming clause, and it asks for the
name before the agent reads a file, plans or edits. The moment carries the
rule: a name states an intention, which is what an agent holds at its first
turn and the one thing no amount of reading improves — while any later moment
is one the agent reaches with work already under way, and weighs against it.
There is no mechanism behind this, which is exactly why the wording and the
position are pinned by a test rather than left to whoever edits the string
next.

> `crates/uze-workspace/src/worktree.rs::naming_is_the_first_thing_the_projected_text_asks_for`

### Work that reaches a commit unnamed is named from that commit

Naming has an automatic half, and it is a Git fact read on the evaluation
pass that already runs — no harness is asked anything, so it behaves the
same on all four and on the next one, and it covers every completion
behaviour rather than only the one that publishes. It applies at `Ready`
and nowhere else, and a derived name the project's vocabulary would refuse
from an agent is never written on its behalf.

> `crates/uze-application/src/application/services/tasks/tests.rs::the_first_commit_names_work_nobody_named`
> `crates/uze-application/src/application/services/tasks/tests.rs::a_commit_outside_the_vocabulary_leaves_the_generated_name`

### An automatic name never overwrites a chosen one

`agent/` is UZE's own branch namespace: a branch inside it is still UZE's to
name, and putting a name outside it is what naming does. So "outside the
prefix" and "somebody chose this" are the same fact, and every automatic
mechanism that could rename (the first-commit derivation, the publish-time
fallback) asks that one predicate rather than inventing a second notion of
"unnamed". Only one automatic rename can ever happen to a task. Asking by
name is not automatic: the agent's own command renames however often it is
asked, and the last name given is the one that stands.

> `crates/uze-workspace/src/task.rs::only_a_branch_outside_uzes_namespace_reads_as_named`
> `crates/uze-application/src/application/services/tasks/tests.rs::naming_again_renames_and_the_last_name_stands`

### The checkout's HEAD is the truth about a task's branch

`task.branch` is a cache of a Git fact, re-read on every evaluation. A branch
renamed outside UZE reaches the sidebar, delivery and sync — and, more
importantly, never leaves UZE asking Git about a ref that no longer exists,
where `commits_ahead` answers `0` and a task with work reads as having none.

> `crates/uze-application/src/application/services/tasks/tests.rs::a_branch_renamed_by_hand_is_adopted_and_still_reaches_ready`

### Drift along the environment chain is reported, never applied on its own

Declared (`agents.yaml`) → locked (`agents.lock`) → installed (the Store) →
delivered (the projected region) is compared from the manifest down, and the
comparison is two file reads and a set difference — no acquisition, no
network. Converging a removal edits the lock and nothing on the machine:
the Store keeps the package and every harness keeps reading it, because
other projects share both and machine scope is `uze remove <plugin> -m`'s.

## Input (M6)

### A keystroke reaches an action through the keymap, and nothing else reads a key

`uze-keys` names every action, says where each is live, and answers both
directions: what a keystroke means, and what key reaches a meaning. One
adapter (`src/ui/keys.rs`) speaks the terminal's dialect — the mirror of
`src/ui/theme.rs` for colour — and the PTY encoder is sanctioned by name
because translating a keystroke into bytes for a pane is not binding it.

> `tests/architecture/layering.rs::architecture_rules_hold` (rule: *one module names a physical key*)

### Every key uze prints came from the keymap

No rendering module contains a chord written as a literal. A help line, a
footer hint and a menu entry all ask `chord_for`, so a rebound key is right
everywhere at once and an invented one cannot be printed at all. The
hand-typed list this replaced had already fallen out of step with the
dispatcher for nine of its bindings.

> `tests/architecture/layering.rs::architecture_rules_hold` (rules: *no surface writes a key down*, *no surface draws its own arrow keys*)
> `src/ui/tests.rs::a_hint_line_reads_its_keys_off_the_keymap`

### Every chord has something to click; not every control needs a chord

An action bound outside the pane names the control that performs it, or is
declared keyboard-only with a written reason. The converse is deliberately
not required: "new space" is a button and an index entry with no key, and
that is a finished design. This is what keeps the keyboard an accelerator
rather than the way in.

> `tests/architecture/affordances.rs::every_action_says_where_its_pointer_lands`
> `tests/architecture/affordances.rs::a_bound_action_is_never_reachable_by_keyboard_alone_without_a_reason`

### Modality is a value, not an order of match arms

What is open is a stack of scopes; the innermost answers first, a sealing
surface answers for everything but `global`, and the pane is total:
what nothing claims is the program's. The doors to the surfaces are one
scope pushed innermost over the pane and over each surface, rather than
the same four chords written once per surface. This replaced two hand-ordered `match` guards — one of which was
wrong, firing three chords through an open overlay while five others were
correctly swallowed.

> `uze-keys::keymap::tests::a_sealed_surface_answers_for_everything_except_global`
> `uze-keys::keymap::tests::the_pane_receives_anything_nothing_claims`

### A key means one thing per keyboard

Two actions may not share a mnemonic — a letter, a digit, a function key —
within management or within the workspace. Structural keys stay
contextual. A keymap that breaks this is refused rather than resolved by
order, which is what retired `r` meaning both *remove* and *refresh*.

> `uze-keys::keymap::tests::one_chord_names_one_action_within_a_keyboard`
> `src/ui/tests.rs::a_letter_names_one_action_and_refreshing_has_its_own`

### A question is answered with the arrows and enter

Every question the product asks — a dialog, the work modal's prompt, the
code surface's delete — has two answers drawn as buttons. The arrows move
between them, enter takes the one the keyboard is on, esc withdraws it,
and no letter answers it: a second, invisible way to say yes is a key
pressed by habit on the wrong question.

> `src/ui/tests.rs::remove_confirmation_flow`
> `src/ui/tests.rs::the_arrows_choose_an_answer_and_enter_takes_it`
> `src/ui/orchestrator/tests.rs::discarding_a_preserved_task_is_asked_for_rather_than_done_on_the_keystroke`

### A move with no key is still reachable from the keyboard

One chord per meaning keeps the keymap short, so the rarer moves hold
none. Each is then a row of the index (F1) wherever it applies — the
management screen's offers and screen-wide actions, the work modal's row
in front, delivering a whole space — so leaving a move unbound never
leaves a keyboard user without it.

> `src/ui/orchestrator/tests/work.rs::a_clean_up_asks_with_what_would_go_and_how_much`
> `src/ui/orchestrator/tests/work.rs::a_parked_agents_subagent_is_joined_on_asking_and_a_running_ones_is_not_offered`

### Leaving uze is never one bare keystroke away

Management owns the whole keyboard, which is why its actions may hold bare
letters — and it is a modal over a session full of running agents, so the
one action that cannot be taken back is the one that may not be a single
letter. `esc` there closes the modal; quitting is `ctrl+q`, global and
named as such.

> `uze-keys::load::tests::leaving_uze_is_never_one_bare_keystroke_away`

### A keymap that cannot be used never takes the keyboard away

A chord that is another key on a terminal, or one that conflicts, is an
error and the keymap already in force stays in force. A chord this
terminal cannot send is never bound. An entry naming something this build
does not know is a warning, so a keymap written for a newer uze still
loads.

### What can be done to a thing is answered once

An entity's offers come from the application layer, and the detail view's
buttons and the index both read that one list. A detail view draws a button
for what can be done now and for nothing else.

## Platforms (windows-support)

### A guard that cannot run on this platform is never installed

A `deny`, `ask` or `transform` group with a handler that has no spelling
for this platform's shell refuses the whole package before the Store holds
any of it: delivered without its guard, the package would let through what
the guard checks.

> `crates/uze-application/src/application/tests.rs::a_package_whose_guard_cannot_run_here_is_not_installed`

### Every platform's hook wrapper answers as the contract records

The generated wrapper of the platform the suite runs on (`exec` on Unix,
`exec.ps1` on Windows) answers every recorded fixture with the recorded
exit, decision and reason; a guard that cannot decide denies.

> `crates/uze-integrations/src/hooks/wrapper_parity_tests.rs::every_fixture_is_answered_as_recorded_on_this_platform`
> `crates/uze-integrations/src/hooks/host_wrapper_tests.rs::a_guard_that_cannot_decide_denies`

### A project command never runs in a shell it was not written for

A setup step or gate with no spelling for this platform is not run, and is
said at placement and in `uze status`; a gate without one refuses delivery.

> `crates/uze-workspace/src/checkout/tests.rs::a_checkout_placed_where_its_gate_cannot_run_says_so`
> `tests/acceptance/workspace_health.rs::status_names_a_gate_this_machine_cannot_run`

### A label is held under a name every filesystem takes

A delivered skill or agent is written under `file_name_for` its label
(`flow:review` is `flow-review` on Windows), and a receipt is matched to a
label through what it holds, never by reading a label back out of a name.

> `crates/uze-platform/src/fs_name.rs::a_label_becomes_a_name_ntfs_holds`
> `crates/uze-core/src/delivery/exposure.rs::a_label_names_the_artifact_that_holds_it`

### Nothing UZE links needs a privilege

A link to a directory reads through, reads back as a link and is removed
alone on every platform (a junction on Windows, which any user may make).

> `crates/uze-platform/src/fs.rs::a_directory_link_reads_through_and_goes_alone`

### A child with no terminal still runs, and asks nobody

A tree started with no terminal runs a line of this platform's shell and
reports its exit: Windows PowerShell given no console at all ran nothing.

> `crates/uze-platform/src/process.rs::a_shell_line_with_no_terminal_still_runs`

### A cross-process lock leaves its holder readable

An exclusive holder refuses another holder, and what it wrote in the lock

### A harness is found wherever its installer put it

The shim and setup find a harness through one lookup: this process's
`PATH`, the one a new shell searches, then where its installer documents
putting it, never anything that leads back to UZE.

### Every citation on this page names a test that exists

Each entry above is tied to the test that proves it, and a tie nothing
checks is one that quietly comes undone: a refactor moves a file, the
property still reads as guarded, and nothing guards it. Every
`` `<path>.rs::<name>` `` here is resolved against the tree, so a moved or
deleted test surfaces on the change that moved it — the same discipline
`journey validate` enforces for a journey's `proves:` one tier up.

Structural only, deliberately. It cannot tell you a property drifted away
from the test that still bears its name, and nothing can.
