"""What an agent that comes back must remember, on every harness.

UZE relaunches an agent into the task it was working in — after a restart,
a crash, or a person picking preserved work back up — and decides, at the
moment the process starts, whether that launch resumes a conversation or
begins one. The deterministic suite proves the decision; only a real
harness can answer whether the conversation actually came back:

    a turn made in the first process reaches the model again in the second.

The scene lays a managed task down by hand, the same way the isolation
scene lays a slot down: task records are the engine's business and are
proven against real Git in the deterministic suite, so writing one here
keeps the run measuring the harness rather than the engine. The relaunch
carries the agent's identity the way a launch UZE composes does — a
variable on the command, with no owner yet, which the first shim takes —
because the shim resumes by that claim and never by the directory. A path
this scene got wrong shows up as a check that fails, never as one that
passes for the wrong reason — the harness would simply start a second
conversation and the earlier turn would be absent.
