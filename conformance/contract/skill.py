"""What a Skill must do, on every harness.

The canonical Skill carries an invocation policy (ADR-030): who may invoke
it, expressed once, translated by each integration into whatever that
vendor encodes it with. The policy is portable; the encoding is not. So
this asserts the policy's *effect* and never looks at an encoding — no
sidecar path, no config key, no screen chrome.

The `flow` fixture carries one Skill of each shape:

    commit    no `invoke:` block   → default: model and user
    analyze   model, not user      → discovered, not user-invocable
    review    user, not model      → user-invocable, not discovered

and one that names a file of its plugin outside `skills/` through
`${PLUGIN_ROOT}` (`locate`), which the model must receive as a path that
leads to that file.

Every absence assertion here is conditional on a presence assertion.
"`review` is not offered to the model" and "nothing was offered to the
model" are the same observation unless something proves the surface was
populated — and for months they were, on three harnesses, which is exactly
how a Skill that never reached the model read as a policy working.
