"""Driving a harness TUI, without knowing which one it is.

Every vertical hand-rolled the same sequence: spawn under a recorder, wait
for a prompt marker, sleep out the warmup, type a character at a time,
accumulate several reads because a repaint splits a name across frames,
strip ANSI, snapshot. Four copies of it drifted in the details that matter
— how long to accumulate, whether to strip before matching — which is how
two verticals ended up matching a heading instead of the content under it.

        One read is not a screen: a TUI repaints by region, so a name can
        arrive split across frames. Matching a single read is how a check
        starts depending on timing — which is why this accumulates.

        But a fixed count of paced reads is not a quiescence test either.
        It sleeps `reads x gap` whether the turn settled in the first
        second or is still streaming at the last, and it can just as easily
        return mid-stream: the old loop stopped at eight reads regardless of
        what the harness was doing. ADR-035 requires an absence assertion to
        evaluate "after the turn settles and the TUI goes quiet" — settling
        is a condition, so measure it. Keep reading while bytes arrive, stop
        once nothing has arrived for `quiet_for`, and keep `reads x gap` as
        the ceiling it always was.

        Strictly more evidence than the loop it replaces: silence here is
        observed, where before it was assumed after a fixed nap.
