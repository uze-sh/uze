"""How one harness is driven, and what it cannot express.

A binding answers mechanics — the command that launches this TUI, the text
that proves it is ready, how a person invokes a Skill here. It never
asserts: the moment a binding decides whether something is correct, the
contract has stopped being common and this file has become another
vertical.

`unsupported` is the one place a harness may decline part of a contract. It
returns a reason, and the run records `Unsupported` in the evidence beside
the passes. An omitted check is invisible; a declared one is reviewable —
the same reason the exposure model treats `Unsupported` as a route rather
than a gap.
