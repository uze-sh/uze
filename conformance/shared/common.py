    env-overridable (`UZE_CONFORMANCE_QUIET_MS` /

    Quiet is measured on the rendered screen, not on bytes arriving. A

    `render_screen` exists: place the bytes on a grid and ask whether what
    the person sees changed. An erase that blanks a line is a change and
    still counts; a caret moving over unchanged text is not.

    Every duration here is `time.monotonic`, never the wall clock. This
    runs on developer machines whose clock is re-synced under them — a WSL
    guest re-syncing with its Windows host stepped `time.time()` back 23
    seconds mid-window, which made the budget expire on its first
    comparison and failed two absence checks on a turn that had settled
    correctly. A clock that can step is not a stopwatch, and a check that

        `settle` is deliberately generous. A caller that does not
        `accumulate` matches only the latest screen, so a frame split across
        two of these calls is a marker that exists and is never seen —
