"""Exploration: does the real AGY TUI run a PreToolUse hook, and does UZE's
generated plugin hook reach it?

Headless AGY loads plugin Skills but gates no tool through hooks (even a
vendor-format deny hook at the shared `hooks.json` lets `run_command`
execute under `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, and headless auto-denies
on permission before any hook otherwise), so hook execution is only
observable in the interactive session. This drives one: the scripted
`run_command` in its declared argument shape, AGY's own log enabled, the
permission prompt answered if it appears, and the log's hook lines read
back once the session exits.

Switches (environment):
  HOOK_TUI_VENDOR=1  install a pure vendor-format deny hook at the shared
                     `~/.gemini/config/hooks.json` instead of relying on
                     UZE's plugin hook — the control for "does the TUI run
                     hooks at all".

  HOOK_TUI_TOUCH=1   one handler per event whose only effect is a file —
                     proves execution regardless of how the answer is read.
  HOOK_TUI_ROOT=workspace  put the file at `/work/.agents/hooks.json`.
  HOOK_TUI_AGENT=<name>    launch with `--agent <name>`.

This experiment pins the **API-key** mode it was written against
(`auth="apikey"`), so its recording stays reproducible now that the vertical
runs signed in; `antigravity/signed-in` is the probe for that mode, and it
is where the same control hook does fire.

Finding (2026-09-02, 1.1.22 and 1.1.24 — pin the image with
`UZE_LAB_IMAGE`): every variant loads the hook (`hooks_manager: loaded 1
named hooks`, both processes) and executes nothing — no file for any
event, the permission prompt surfaces, the approved command runs. The
executor is gated by `CustomizationConfig.enable_json_hooks`, built by the
CLI's SDK from a server-delivered feature provider; the vertical now
measures that gate (`hooks > vendor`) before judging UZE's plugin hook.

Run: python3 conformance/lab.py --harness antigravity --experiment antigravity/hook-tui
