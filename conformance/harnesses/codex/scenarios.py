"""Codex scenario (latest channel) — Real Harness + Synthetic World.

Phase A (TUI): auth.json seed skips login; trust prompt dismissed; prompt;
/skills lists the default Skill delivered through the generated plugin;
/plugins lists the plugin; /mcp lists the UZE-delivered server; deterministic
turn; the model request carries `flow:commit` and never `flow:review`.

Phase B (CLI/state): `codex plugin list` reports the UZE plugins installed +
enabled (secondary; the /plugins TUI surface is the primary assertion).

Phase C (invocation policy, ADR-030): `codex debug prompt-input` renders the
model-visible catalog with zero model calls; a user-only Skill must be absent
from it and a default one present, with a sidecar-removal control proving the
exclusion is caused by Codex reading UZE's policy sidecar.

Every absence assertion here is guarded by a presence precondition in the
same capture: an empty catalog hides nothing, it proves nothing.

    """auth.json seed skips the login screen; the directory-trust prompt is
    dismissed with Enter (its default first option) until the directory is
    trusted. Returns (raw, screen).

    The prompt is recognised by either wording it has had: "Do you trust"
    up to codex-cli 0.155, "Trust this folder?" from 0.156 on, which also
    renamed the option to "Trust and continue". Missing it left every phase
    that opens the TUI parked on the dialog.

    The composer line is chrome, not readiness. codex-cli 0.153.2 paints
    "Ask Codex to do anything" while the header still reads
    `directory: loading`, and only *then* opens the trust dialog over it — so
    a wait that accepts that line returns before the dialog exists, and the
    prompt typed next is swallowed by the dialog instead of starting a turn.
    That race is why a run failed a different subset of the hooks checks each
    time, every one of them reporting a turn that never settled: until the
    directory is trusted the harness loads no project-local hooks at all.

    The header is the signal that cannot race: `directory: loading` until the
    directory is trusted, the working directory afterwards. The path itself is
    never asserted — the isolation phase runs in a worktree, not /work — only
    that `loading` is gone. Reading it off `render_screen` rather than a
    snapshot is what makes it reliable: a read can land mid-redraw, and the
    grid is where the current header exists.

    codex-cli 0.157 starts its shared app-server daemon on an interactive
    launch (openai/codex#47179): it paints a first frame whose header
    already names the directory, steps out of the alternate screen to start
    (and, on a fresh home, install) the daemon, and only then opens the
    trust dialog in a second frame. The directory is no longer the signal
    that cannot race; the model is — `model: loading` until the session the
    daemon serves exists, which is after the directory is trusted. Both are
    required, so the older order still settles the same way.

    """Invocation policy (ADR-030) as the REAL Codex binary renders it.

    This is the real-harness half of what `tests/integrations/harness/codex.rs`
    proves deterministically. It used to live there too, spawning `codex` from
    the developer's own PATH — which is UZE's runtime shim on any dogfooding
    machine, so it measured the host rather than Codex. Here the binary, the
    HOME, and the network are the container's.

    `codex debug prompt-input` renders exactly what the model would receive,
    with zero model calls. The `flow` fixture carries every shape: `commit`
    (default: model-visible), `review` (`invoke: {model: false, user:
    true}`: user-only) and `analyze` (model-only). Expected: `flow:commit`
    and `flow:analyze` are offered, `flow:review` is not.

    Delivery shape, so the evidence is read where it lives: `commit` and
    `review` arrive through the GENERATED native plugin (`uze inspect`
    reports them "provided by package"), which Codex stages into its own
    cache under `$CODEX_HOME/plugins/cache/uze-store/flow/<version>/` — the
    sidecar Codex actually reads is that cache copy. `analyze` is Degraded
    on Codex and attached individually under `~/.agents/skills`.

    The control matters as much as the assertion. Deleting the
    `agents/openai.yaml` policy sidecar from the cache copy must bring
    `flow:review` back — proving the exclusion is caused by Codex genuinely
    reading the sidecar UZE wrote, not by the Skill being absent, misnamed,
    or undelivered for some unrelated reason.
