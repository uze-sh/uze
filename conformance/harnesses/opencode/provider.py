"""Minimal deterministic fake OpenAI-compatible provider — the OpenCode stub.

Contract (derived from observed behavior of the REAL opencode 1.18.23):
  * The provider is declared in the global opencode.json with a custom
    `baseURL` (`@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`) — unlike claude/codex there is NO
    hardcoded host to intercept; the TUI talks plain HTTP to this server.
  * Model calls are `POST /v1/chat/completions` (stream=true, OpenAI Chat
    Completions API), answered with SSE `data:` chunks and a `data: [DONE]`
    terminal.
  * Tool calls follow the streaming shape the AI SDK tracks: a first delta
    carrying `role`/`id`/`name`, a second delta with `arguments`, then
    `finish_reason: "tool_calls"`. After the harness executes the MCP tool
    and returns `role: "tool"` content, the next turn answers the final
    text.

Modes (PROVIDER_MODE):
  static   : every turn -> a text SSE (RESPONSE_TEXT).
  toolcall : the first request carrying tools (no tool result yet) ->
             tool call SSE to the UZE MCP tool; requests carrying the
             `role: "tool"` result -> final text SSE (FINAL_TEXT). Proves
             the deep MCP round-trip with zero model.

This stub records ONLY a structural summary of each request (skill markers,
catalog presence, tool-result presence, MCP proof) — never the verbatim
body — into PROVIDER_STRUCT: the model-facing observation boundary.
