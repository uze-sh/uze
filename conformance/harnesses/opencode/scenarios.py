"""OpenCode scenario (latest channel) — Real Harness + Synthetic World.

Phase A (TUI): the global opencode.json (custom provider + model + MCP)
makes the TUI boot straight to the prompt (no onboarding, observed);
/skills (flow:commit / flow:review / uze:init listed); /mcps (the UZE
MCP server connected + enabled); deterministic turn; provider-request
observation (model-visible Skill present; user-only skill visible to the
model — opencode lists every registered skill in the system prompt, so the
policy is ADAPTED); MCP tool invocation inside the interactive TUI (proof
round-trip: the real opencode executed the real MCP server and returned the
proof value).

OpenCode is the one harness whose provider is configurable: unlike
claude/codex there is no hardcoded host to intercept — the custom
`baseURL` in the config is the hook, plain HTTP.
