"""Antigravity scenario (latest channel) — Real Harness + Synthetic World.

The session runs **signed in**, against a synthetic identity: a `consumer`
token file the CLI reads as a Google account, and the CloudCode plane
answered by the run's own provider (identity, tier, flags, model catalogue,
model path). That is the mode users are in. API-key mode is measured too:
until 1.1.24 it loaded `hooks.json` hooks and never ran them (vendor bug
google-antigravity/antigravity-cli#893, kept on the report as a
declaration); since 1.1.25 the same probe sees the hook fire there, so
that check is asserted like the rest.

Phase A (TUI): prompt + synthetic credential, /skills (flow:commit,
flow:review, uze:init), /mcp (server listed + tools enumerated),
deterministic turn, model-only Skill hidden from the slash surface but
present for the model, user-only Skill CAPABILITY_ADAPTED, MCP tool invocation
inside the interactive TUI (proof round-trip).

Phase B (CLI/state): plugin registration via `agy plugin list` + staged
mcp_config.json (AGY has no plugin TUI surface — verified).

    Signed in, it does: the deny hook runs, the TUI renders `Tool call
    denied by pre-tool hook: blocked by protect-env`, and the reason reaches
    the conversation as the tool outcome (1.1.24, 2026-09-02, experiment
    `antigravity/signed-in`). The UZE hook checks that follow are therefore
    asserted, not declared.

    The gate stays a live precondition rather than an assumption because the
    thing it measures is a vendor gate, not ours: the executor reads
    `enable_json_hooks`, field 17 of `exa.cortex_pb.CustomizationConfig`,
    which the CLI only ever receives over the CloudCode backend it speaks
    when signed in. Under `GEMINI_API_KEY` no such config arrived on 1.1.24,
    whatever the `json-hooks-enabled` flag said — vendor bug
    google-antigravity/antigravity-cli#893 — and `phase_hooks_api_key_mode`
    re-runs this control hook there every run. If a future build closed the
    gate in signed-in mode too, this check would say so instead of the suite
    quietly proving nothing. `phase_hooks_delivery` answers the other half:

    This is the check that decided the delivery route. UZE used to write
    Antigravity's hooks into the generated native plugin, which is what the
    vendor's shipped plugin guide documents ("Hooks defined in
    `plugins/<name>/hooks.json` are registered and run during the agent's
    lifecycle"). On 1.1.24 they are not: `agy plugin validate` counted the
    plugin's three hooks, the plugin was listed with a `hooks` component and
    enabled in `config.json`, and the session still reported `loaded 0 named
    hooks from 0 hooks.json file(s)` — it never opened the file. UZE now
    merges its named entries into the shared `~/.gemini/config/hooks.json`,
    where the same session reports `loaded 3 named hooks from 1 hooks.json
    file(s)` and the handlers run.

    It stays measured every run rather than retired with the move: it is
    what proves the route still works, and what would say a later build
    started reading plugin hooks — at which point moving back is a measured
    decision, not a guess.

    The provider scripts a `run_command` functionCall whose arguments the
    plugin's `guard` handler examines (delivered through UZE's generated
    named-entry plugin); `kind` selects the scenario, identical semantics to
    the claude/codex/opencode verticals:

      deny  : arguments contain `secrets` -> the hook denies (reason
              "blocked by protect-env") and the second handler never runs;
              run_command itself never executes.
      allow : plain echo arguments -> the hook allows, run_command runs.
      order : a two-handler group whose first handler always denies -> the
              second handler's marker must never appear (first-deny-wins).

    Evidence = what the REAL harness relayed: hook marker presence/absence
    in the provider-observed conversation plus the TUI denial surface.

    Two vacuities hid here until 2026-09-02, and both are why the presence
    check `hooks-*-denial-relayed` gates the absence checks: the provider
    answered the harness's first request with the functionCall, which on
    1.1.24 is a side call to a lighter model with no tools declared, so the
    user's turn never saw a tool; and the call carried `command`, not the
    `CommandLine`/`Cwd`/`WaitMsBeforeAsync`/`toolSummary`/`toolAction` the
    tool declares, which the harness rejects as invalid arguments before a
    hook runs. The generated plugin `hooks.json` also had its named entries
    wrapped under a `hooks` key the vendor reads as one dead hook.

    `blocked` carries the reason a live precondition gave for not judging
    UZE's delivery this run (the vendor runs no hook at all, or it never
    loads the one UZE delivered). Every check here is then recorded as a
    declaration carrying that reason — the turn would only re-measure a
