"""Minimal deterministic fake Gemini provider — the permanent runtime stub.

Contract (derived from observed behavior of the REAL AGY 1.1.20):
  * AGY (API-key mode) POSTs to `{GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL}/v1beta/models/
    {model}:streamGenerateContent?alt=sse` with a GenerateContent JSON body.
  * The response is an SSE stream of `data: {json}` lines. IMPORTANT: it must
    NOT contain a `data: [DONE]` terminal — AGY's stream parser fails on it
    (observed: "error unmarshalling data data: [DONE]").

It also serves the harness's **signed-in plane** over TLS on 443: the
feature flags that decide whether `hooks.json` hooks execute at all, the
identity/account endpoints, and — when the vertical runs signed in — the
model path itself. Observed on a real, logged-in session (AGY 1.1.22
binary, backend UA `antigravity/cli/1.1.24`, 2026-09-02):

  * the language-server process polls Unleash at
    `GET https://antigravity-unleash.goog/api/client/features` (and
    `POST /api/client/register`), evaluating strategies locally with
    `unleash-client-go`; the flag that gates JSON hooks is
    `json-hooks-enabled` ("Whether to enable hooks based on json files"),
    a `flexibleRollout` at 100% constrained to `ide IN [jetski]` — which
    is the context this CLI reports;
  * `POST https://daily-cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/v1internal:listExperiments`
    answers the same flag as `{"name":"json-hooks-enabled","boolValue":true}`.

Both are served here exactly as recorded — the strategy is replayed, not
flattened to a bare `default`, so the harness's own evaluation is what
decides. The remaining `v1internal:*` endpoints and `play.googleapis.com/log`
are answered with the smallest shape that keeps the harness moving; no tier,
quota or entitlement semantics are invented.

**Signed-in ("consumer") mode.** With a `consumer` token file in place the
CLI stops honouring `GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL` and speaks the CloudCode
protocol instead. Shapes observed on the same session (structure only; every
value served here is synthetic):

  * `GET https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v2/userinfo` ->
    `{id, email, verified_email, name, given_name, picture}`;
  * `POST https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token` (only if a refresh is
    attempted) -> `{access_token, token_type, expires_in}`;
  * `POST https://daily-cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/v1internal:<rpc>` with
    JSON bodies: `fetchUserInfo` -> `{userSettings, regionCode}`,
    `loadCodeAssist` -> a tier document, `listExperiments` -> the flag list
    above, and `setUserSettings` / `retrieveUserQuotaSummary` /
    `fetchAdminControls` / `fetchAvailableModels` /
    `recordCodeAssistMetrics` / `writeTrajectoryAcls` -> `{}`;
  * `POST …/v1internal:streamGenerateContent`, whose body wraps the same
    GenerateContent request as `{project, requestId, model, userAgent,
    requestType, request:{…}}` and whose SSE events wrap each
    GenerateContentResponse as `{"response": …, "traceId": …, "metadata":
    {}}`.

The model logic is the one below, unchanged: the CloudCode listener unwraps
`request` before the same summary/decision path and re-wraps every event it
emits, so `static`/`toolcall`, `wants_function_call` and the variation
machinery behave identically in both auth modes.

Modes (PROVIDER_MODE):
  static   : serve the synthetic SSE fixture to every request (default).
  toolcall : request #1 -> functionCall(call_mcp_tool, FC_ARGS) so the REAL
             harness executes a real MCP server; request #2+ -> FINAL text.
             This proves the deep MCP tool-call path with zero model.

This stub records ONLY a structural summary of each request — never the
verbatim body — into a JSON file (PROVIDER_STRUCT). That summary is the
conformance observation boundary: it lets tests assert what the REAL AGY sent
toward its provider (model-visible vs user-only Skills, MCP tool execution)
without persisting vendor internal payloads.

Env:
  PROVIDER_MODE    : static | toolcall
  PROVIDER_STRUCT  : path to write the structural summary (JSON list)
  RESP_SSE         : path to the synthetic SSE response to serve (static)
  FC_ARGS          : JSON args for the call_mcp_tool functionCall (toolcall)
  FINAL_TEXT       : deterministic text served after request #1 (toolcall)
  PORT (argv[1])   : listen port
