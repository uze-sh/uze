//! TUI — the one place uze names a physical key.
//!
//! `uze-keys` is a leaf crate that knows no terminal, the way `uze-theme`
//! knows no rendering library. This module is the adapter between the two
//! worlds: crossterm's key events become [`Chord`]s here, and nothing
//! outside this file may name `KeyCode` at all — a rule
//! `tests/architecture/layering.rs` holds, with the PTY encoder sanctioned
//! by name because translating a key into bytes for a pane is a different
//! job from binding one.
//!
//! It also owns the keyboard handshake. Without the enhancement protocol a
//! terminal has three ways to encode a keystroke — a character, a control
//! byte, an escape sequence — and several chords have no encoding at all
//! (see `uze_keys::Tier`). When the host supports the protocol uze asks for
//! **disambiguation only**: reporting key *releases* as well would double
//! every keystroke forwarded into a pane, and reporting alternate keys
//! would change what a keystroke means on a non-US layout. What arrives is
//! then filtered to presses, so nothing downstream has to know whether the
//! handshake happened.
