//! TUI view — Settings route.
//!
//! The choices `config.toml` holds, one group per section, so a setting
//! added later has an obvious place and the file and the screen read the
//! same way. Keys stays a screen of its own: another file, and a different
//! kind of choosing.
//!
//! Appearance is two choices rather than one: the palette, and —
//! chosen apart from it — the set of glyphs every mark is drawn from. A
//! font is installed once and a palette is picked on a whim, so welding
//! them together meant an operator with a patched font had to give up every
//! theme, or copy forty-four glyphs into their overrides.
//!
//! Shaped like Keys — grouped choices with a detail side — for the reason
//! Keys is shaped like Plugins: a screen someone visits rarely is better
//! off looking like one they already know. The choices themselves are cards
//! rather than rows, because what a theme or a set *is* cannot be said in
//! words: it has to be shown, and a row has one line to show it in.
//!
//! The one thing here that is its own: **every glyph set is drawn in its own
//! glyphs.** No terminal can be asked which font it is rendering with — no
//! escape sequence answers it, and a cursor-position probe measures width
//! rather than presence, so a missing glyph and a present one both come back
//! as one cell. Detection is therefore not a thing UZE can do honestly, and
//! a question at setup would ask the operator to recall from memory a fact
//! only the screen can settle. So the screen shows the marks, and the
//! operator decides by looking at them: a set this terminal cannot draw is
//! visible as tofu, and a set whose declared widths are wrong is visible as
//! a ragged preview column, both before anything is chosen.
