//! One attach, and what it does with an event.
//!
//! Split out of `orchestrator.rs`'s `attach_workspace`, which had grown to
//! ~1.5k lines carrying five jobs at once: the server handshake, the frame
//! loop, the cadence of every background read, slot lifecycle, and a
//! 46-arm `match` over every key and click the workspace understands.
//!
//! Two of those live here — [`Attach::pump`], which absorbs what the
//! server and the background reads have said and asks for whatever has
//! gone stale, and [`Attach::handle`], which answers one event. [`Attach`]
//! itself is the state both needed: the model, the connection it drives
//! the server through, and the channels its reads answer on, so a handler
//! reaches for a field instead of closing over a local and the loop that
//! calls them fits on a screen.
//!
//! # Why one match became several
//!
//! The arms were never mixed: a `Event::Key(_) if …` guard can only ever
//! match a key, and every mouse arm tested exactly one `MouseEventKind`.
//! Splitting by event kind is therefore exact rather than a judgement
//! call, and it leaves the thing the guards *do* encode legible — modal
//! precedence. In [`Attach::key`] and [`Attach::press`] the order of the
//! guards is the order overlays stack in, and each overlay's own keys
//! live in a method named after it, so those two lists are the precedence
//! and nothing else. `WorkspaceModel::no_modal_open` names the same set
//! from one place.
