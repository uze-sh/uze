//! A toast: something happened, said where the reader is looking, and gone
//! again without being dismissed.
//!
//! # Why they are transient and what that costs
//!
//! A toast covers what is behind it, and in this product what is behind it
//! is a pane an agent is writing into. That is the whole tension: the
//! message is worth interrupting for, the output underneath is the reason
//! anybody is here. So a toast is narrow, right-aligned, and leaves on its
//! own — and the one kind that does not leave on its own is the one the
//! reader has to answer, which is exactly the trade worth making.
//!
//! The remaining seconds are *drawn*. A box that vanishes on a clock
//! nobody can see reads as a glitch the first time and as something the
//! reader has to hurry for after that; a box that says `4s` is one they
//! can decide to ignore. One that stays draws no clock at all — the `✕`
//! beside it already says the message can be ended, and a word saying
//! "this one has no clock" is a thing to read on every toast to learn
//! something about one of them.
//!
//! # What a toast is not
//!
//! Not a log — it is gone, so anything that must be readable afterwards
//! belongs somewhere that keeps it. Not a dialog — it never takes the
//! keyboard, and the screen behind it stays live and answerable. Not a
//! progress report — work still running is the header's own business,
//! where it can sit as long as it needs to.
