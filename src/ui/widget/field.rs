//! A text input: what has been typed, where typing would land, and the
//! hint standing in while nothing has been.
//!
//! # The empty focused field
//!
//! The state that decides whether something reads as an input is the one
//! with nothing in it. A field holding text is obvious; a field holding
//! nothing is a caption unless something says otherwise, and the thing
//! that says otherwise is the caret.
//!
//! Four inputs answered that differently. The picker's query row and the
//! rename buffers showed a caret from the first frame. The list screens'
//! filter showed none, but drew an underline, so its extent said "field"
//! even empty. The open index showed neither — no underline, no caret,
//! just muted words — and was found to be typable only by someone typing
//! into it.
//!
//! So the rule is here rather than at four call sites: **a focused field
//! always shows its caret**, before the placeholder when empty and after
//! the text when not. What a caller still chooses is the field's *lead* —
//! an underline, a `❯`, a gutter that lines it up with the rows below —
//! because that is about where the field sits, not about what it is.
//!
//! # One caret
//!
//! [`Symbol::CursorText`] is documented in the theme as "the caret in a
//! text input"; [`Symbol::BarThin`] is one of the bars that mark the edge
//! of a row. Three of the seven inputs drew the bar. They are not
//! interchangeable — a glyph set may spell them differently, and the
//! reason to name a symbol at all is that the theme decides what it looks
//! like.
