//! The one scrollbar the product draws.
//!
//! It arrived twice — the Keys list grew one, and the code surface grew
//! two more — and the second time is when a shared thing is worth making,
//! not the first. What that duplication produced in the meantime is
//! exactly what a shared control prevents: two grooves with different
//! glyphs and different hues, doing the same job on two screens of the
//! same product.
//!
//! It answers the question a long list cannot answer by itself — whether
//! there is more, and how much — and it takes the answer back: a click
//! jumps there and a drag keeps jumping, which is the gesture anyone who
//! has seen a scrollbar tries first. Drawing something that looks like a
//! control and does nothing is worse than not drawing it.
//!
//! # Two questions, one control
//!
//! A pointer on the track means different things to different lists, and
//! the difference is real rather than an inconsistency to iron out:
//!
//! - A list whose window is *derived from the selection* — the Keys
//!   screen — asks [`Scrollbar::item_at`]: the track is a picture of the
//!   whole list, so its top row is the first item and its bottom row the
//!   last.
//! - A list that keeps a scroll offset of its own — the code surface —
//!   asks [`Scrollbar::first_at`]: the track is a picture of where the
//!   *window* can go, so its bottom is the last screenful rather than the
//!   last line.
//!
//! Naming both keeps each screen honest about which it is, instead of one
//! of them quietly scrolling a line short.
