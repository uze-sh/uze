//! Choosing the directory a new space is born from.
//!
//! A space is born from a root, and that root is a directory that already
//! exists — so the prompt is a filter over real directories rather than a
//! free-text path. What the user types names a directory to list and a
//! segment to match inside it: the list narrows on every keystroke, `Tab`
//! completes the row it lands on, and `Enter` creates the space there.
//!
//! **The input is the path.** A separator is a character like any other:
//! the text before the last one names the directory to list, the text
//! after it is matched inside it, and nothing the prompt is doing lives
//! anywhere the typed line does not show. A `/` used to descend into
//! whichever row happened to be selected and clear the line, which is an
//! implicit `Tab` nobody asked for — it took what was being typed and
//! answered with something else.
//!
//! The choice is always a listed row, never the directory being listed —
//! which is why deleting the trailing separator is how you pick that
//! directory itself: it becomes a segment matched inside its own parent,
//! and lands on the row bearing its name.
