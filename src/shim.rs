//! PATH shim entry point.
//!
//! This is the part of `uze` that runs when the binary is invoked under a
//! shim symlink name (`~/.uze/shims/<name>`, e.g. `claude`, `codex`,
//! `opencode`) rather than as `uze` itself — see
//! `UzeApplication::ensure_runtime_shim`, which is what creates that
//! symlink at `~/.uze/shims/<name>` as an ordinary part of
//! `uze setup <harness>`, for whichever integrations opt in. Which names
//! count is the registry's answer, never this file's.
//!
//! Deliberately thin, and deliberately generic: every vendor-specific
//! decision comes from `IntegrationPort::runtime_contribution`. This file
//! only detects the invocation, resolves the real binary, asks the matching
//! integration what to add, and `exec`s — no `UzeApplication`, no Store
//! scan, no marketplace refresh, no network. Those are exactly the costs
//! kept out of this hot path.
//!
//! `RUNTIME INFRASTRUCTURE`, not `CONTEXT DELIVERY POLICY` — this file
//! neither knows nor cares whether runtime projection ever replaces the
//! existing persistent `CLAUDE.md` bridge; it only launches
//! whatever the integration decided.
