//! Keeping the binary the installer placed current, and saying so.
//!
//! Only a binary `install.sh` placed is ever replaced. The installer leaves
//! a receipt (`state/install.json`) naming the file it wrote, and a binary
//! running from anywhere else — `cargo install`, `make install`, a package
//! manager, `target/debug` — belongs to whatever put it there, and is left
//! to it: `uze upgrade` says why when asked. That receipt is
//! what ADR-034 was guarding when it kept a self-update out of scope; a
//! replacement that cannot tell whose file it is replacing is the thing to
//! refuse, and the receipt answers the question.
//!
//! The replacement is a rename over the old file, so a process already
//! running from it — the terminal server, a pane's shim, this very client —
//! keeps the inode it started from, and the next launch is the first to run
//! the new release. Nothing here restarts anything.
//!
//! `uze upgrade` is the same replacement asked for by a person: it runs in
//! the foreground, and when it replaces nothing it says why — the receipt
//! missing, or naming a different file than the `uze` that is running.
//!
//! `UZE_AUTOUPDATE=off` stops the check entirely, `notify` checks without
//! ever replacing — leaving it to `uze upgrade` — and `CI` being set means off unless the variable says
//! otherwise: a disposable machine has no use for a newer binary than the
//! one it was handed.
//!
//! `UZE_BASE_URL` is `install.sh`'s testing override and stops there. A
//! shipped `uze` fetches from [`RELEASES`] and nowhere else, because this
//! module downloads a binary and renames it over the one in `PATH`: were
//! the download root an environment variable, anything that can set one —
//! a cloned repository's `.envrc`, a `Makefile`, a parent process — would
//! choose which binary a person runs from then on, and the checksum could
//! not tell, since `SHASUMS256.txt` comes from that same root. The
//! integrity check proves the bytes arrived whole from the release page;
//! only the fixed origin makes that page the right one. A debug build
//! still honours the variable so the offline fixture suite can drive a
//! whole pass without a network — a developer's own build is not the
//! threat this closes.
