//! Where a trace goes.
//!
//! Every crate below this one opens `tracing` spans and records events;
//! none of them knows whether anything is listening. This module is the
//! one place that decides, once per process, in `main`:
//!
//! - **A journal**, for the two processes that outlive the gesture that
//!   started them: the TUI and the terminal server. Always on, whatever
//!   the environment says, because the thing worth reading afterwards is
//!   the run nobody expected to have to read — see [`Sink::Journal`].
//! - **`UZE_LOG=<filter>`** subscribes a text layer on stderr for a
//!   command, and raises the journal's own level, using
//!   `tracing_subscriber`'s filter syntax (`info`, `uze_git=debug`, …).
//! - **`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`**, in a binary built with the
//!   `telemetry` feature, subscribes an OTLP exporter as well; the guard
//!   [`Telemetry`] flushes it before the process exits, so a command that
//!   ran for five milliseconds still reports its whole trace.
//!
//! For a one-shot command with none of them set, nothing subscribes and a
//! span costs a branch.
//!
//! The trace crosses one process boundary: the runtime shim `exec`s a
//! harness, and the harness runs `uze` again — an agent inside it asking
//! UZE something. The shim puts its span's context into the child's
//! environment as W3C `TRACEPARENT`, the harness passes its environment
//! through, and that `uze` adopts it as its root's parent, so the two are
//! one trace. Both halves are no-ops without the feature: there is no
//! trace id to carry.
