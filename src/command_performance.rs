//! Enforces that every CLI command is either fast (`Budgeted`, backed by an
//! actual performance-budget test) or explicitly `JustifiedSlow` with a
//! stated, reviewable reason — see `specs/cli-performance/spec.md` and
//! ADR 018 (`docs/adr/018-cache-harness-detection-with-fingerprint-ttl-
//! invalidation.md`). This is the durable guardrail against the exact
//! failure mode that motivated this module: `ensure_default_plugins()`
//! became a hidden, unmeasured bottleneck on nearly every command without
//! anyone deciding that was acceptable, because nothing checked. A command
//! added to `Command`/`ContextAction`/`MarketplaceAction`/`ConfigAction`
//! without a matching entry here fails the test suite by name (see
//! `tests::every_cli_command_is_classified`), instead of silently shipping
//! unmeasured.
//!
//! This module is test-only tooling: it changes nothing about what any
//! command does. `CLASSIFICATION` is consulted only by the tests below.
