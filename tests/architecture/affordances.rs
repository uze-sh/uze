//! Every chord has something to click.
//!
//! The product's thesis is that the keyboard is an accelerator, never the
//! way in: everything clickable, nothing behind a keystroke you had to
//! read about first. That is a claim about the whole action vocabulary,
//! and a claim nothing checks is a claim that decays — the alphabet this
//! change replaced grew one letter at a time, each of them reasonable, and
//! none of them ever offered on screen.
//!
//! So each action says where its pointer lands. The table is the point: a
//! new binding does not compile past it without someone answering "and
//! where do you click that?", which is the question that keeps this a
//! product you can use without a manual.
//!
//! The converse is deliberately *not* required. An affordance needs no
//! chord: "new space" is a button and an index entry with no key at all,
//! and that is a finished design rather than a gap.
