# Offline fixture test for install.sh.
#
# Serves synthetic release artifacts (fake `uze` binaries, real SHA-256
# sums, corrupt checksums) over localhost HTTP and exercises the installer:
# glibc and musl detection, macOS on both architectures, pinned versions,
# checksum-mismatch refusal, and unsupported platform fail-closed paths.
# Zero network access required.

# Usage: sh tests/scripts/installer-test.sh
