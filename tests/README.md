# UZE test suite

This is the map of the whole suite: **what** is tested, **at which level**,
**against which environment**, **with which harness**, and **what evidence a
passing test provides**. A green `cargo test` is not the story: the story is
which cell of the matrices below is covered by which test file.

## Boundary (naming)

- `tests/` (incl. `tests/acceptance/`) = **deterministic product tests**:
  L0/L1 contracts/components and L3 product acceptance. Owned by the main
  suite; never requires a real harness.
- `conformance/` = **external harness conformance** (the Lab): L2
  real-harness/model-free evidence, L4 optional model behavior, CONTROL
  when needed. Vendor-specific by design; never linked into `tests/`.
- `journeys/` = **product journeys**: a user's flow performed through the
  real CLI *and* the real TUI in a disposable world, then checked against
  the machine it left behind. Not named `e2e/` on purpose — "E2E" already
  labels the Lab's CI job and L3's own description, and a third claimant
  makes all three vaguer.

## Levels

| Level | What it proves | Environment | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L0 — Unit** | pure logic: parsing, normalization, identity, deterministic helpers | nothing real; trivial temp only | `#[cfg(test)]` inside `crates/*/src/**`, `src/**`; `tests/packages/*`, `tests/projection/*` helpers |
| **L1 — Component/Contract** | a subsystem's contract on a real isolated filesystem, with a *fake* process boundary | isolated temp HOME/UZE_HOME, no developer state, fake harness CLIs only | `tests/{cli,memory,packages,workspace,lifecycle,projection}/**`, `tests/integrations/**` |
| **L2 — Harness Conformance** | real vendor binary semantics, isolated HOME/UZE_HOME, no model calls | the real vendor binary in a disposable container: synthetic provider, zero Internet, zero tokens | the `conformance/` container lab (Tiers 1-2) — there is no in-repo L2 probe |
| **L3 — Acceptance** | public user-level scenario end-to-end through the real `uze` binary | clean isolated `TestEnvironment` (real UZE binary, fake or controlled harness CLIs) | `tests/acceptance/**` |
| **L3.5 — Journey** | a user's flow performed through the real CLI and the real TUI, checked against real machine state (files, Git, recorded task state, processes) — never against UZE's own report | disposable sandbox HOME/UZE_HOME/XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, generated harness stand-ins, offline; a pinned container in CI | `journeys/suites/*.yml` (see `journeys/README.md`) |
| **L4 — Manual/Model behavioral** | model-invocation or interactive-only behavior | manual/agentic eval, never CI | `tests/_fixtures/scenarios/eval/` (see `docs/capabilities/uze-skill.md`) |

Rules:

- **L3 exercises the public path**: `uze` binary → Application → Store/Engine
  → Integration. No test recreates the implementation.
- **Never call a real vendor CLI from ordinary CI**: L2 probes are
  skip-if-absent by design; the `conformance/` lab is the verdict where real vendor
  behavior matters.
- The same invariant at multiple levels is *good* (L0 exact-coverage
  helper + L3 "nothing missing after install"). Duplicates at the *same*
  level are not.

## Structure

```
tests/
├── cli/             CLI layer: grammar (ADR-019), machine-scoped commands, budget (what a warm command leaves behind)
├── memory/          what UZE sees: context inspection, reconciliation, projections
├── packages/        acquisition, containment, Store/Engine, canonical model
├── workspace/       agents.lock consumer, marketplace (incl. malformed), root resolution
├── lifecycle/       install (application layer), future: update/remove/receipts/drift
├── projection/      exposure naming, invocation labels/policy, shared skill roots
├── integrations/    contract, capability+lifecycle conformance, runtime-shim boundary,
│   ├── harness/     per-harness invocation-policy semantics (claude/codex/opencode/antigravity)
├── acceptance/      L3 scenarios (see below)
└── fixtures/        canonical / foreign / scenarios / golden (see tests/_fixtures/README.md)
```

Each `tests/<domain>/main.rs` is the Cargo test target (directory-`main.rs`
layout); the `.rs` files are its modules. `tests/` files that predate the
refactor (consumer.rs's historically-named tests, canonical_package.rs)
live inside their domain with behavior-descriptive test names.

## Per-harness conformance is asked, not copied

`tests/integrations/capability_conformance.rs` and
`lifecycle_conformance.rs` take their subjects from
`IntegrationRegistry::isolated` — the product's own composition root — so a
harness added to UZE enters both suites automatically. Each question is a
single loop over every registered harness, and the vendor knowledge those
loops need (where an envelope lives, how one is spelled) is held in exactly
one place, `tests/integrations/subjects.rs`.

A harness with no binding there fails by name, with the fix in the message.
A harness that genuinely has no surface for a question declares
`Support::NotApplicable("<reason>")`, which
`every_exemption_from_this_suite_states_its_reason` checks — the same
discipline the Lab's `bindings.unsupported` enforces, for the same reason: a
matrix cannot tell a deliberate exemption from a forgotten one unless the
exemption is written down.

This replaced 19 hand-copied per-harness tests. Do not add a
`<vendor>_<scenario>` test to those two files: add the question to the loop
and the vendor's spelling to `subjects.rs`. A vendor-named test there is only
right when the *outcome* is about a named pair (`codex_opencode_agree_on_the_shared_skill_root`).

## Support crate

`crates/uze-testkit` owns the shared infrastructure:

- `temp::TestEnvironment` — isolated HOME/UZE_HOME/PATH/cwd/fake-bin and
  per-harness config homes, with real-home safety guards. Every child
  process gets the environment through `env::command` (process env of the
  test binary is never mutated); in-process `PATH`/`HOME` mutation goes
  through `env::scope` (crate-wide mutex + RAII restore).
- `fake_harness::FakeHarness` — declarative fake CLI binaries (rule table +
  invocation log), including the vendor plugin-marketplace state machine
  (`Action::VendorMarketplace`) and Antigravity's stub-install lifecycle.
- `fixtures` — canonical `/foreign/`/`scenarios/`/`golden` resolution.
  (Package-shaped fixtures for the integration suites live beside them in
  `tests/integrations/fixtures.rs`, one copy: they were byte-identical in
  two conformance files, and the copy a change forgets is the one whose
  suite quietly stops proving what it says.)
- `scenario::Scenario` — declarative system-state builder.
- `assertions` — context-carrying fs/process assertions + `snapshot_dir`.

## Commands

```bash
make journey                            # one product journey, on this machine
make journey-docker                     # the same journey in the pinned container
cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast   # the full suite (includes acceptance)
cargo test -p uze --test acceptance      # L3 only (the release signal)
cargo test -p uze --test integrations    # conformance + per-harness semantics
cargo test -p uze --test projection      # naming/labels/skill roots
make test-acceptance / make test-conformance  # same as above
python3 conformance/lab.py --harness codex  # L2, the real binary in the Lab
```

Real-harness policy: the deterministic suite never spawns a vendor binary.
The `conformance/` lab (Docker, offline L2) is the only place a real-vendor
verdict is produced, and it is never required for the ordinary suite. An
in-repo skip-if-absent probe was tried and removed: it reported green on every
machine that did not have the binary, which is every machine.

## Where does a new test go?

```text
Does it need a real harness CLI?
├── yes ──> conformance/, as an L2 or L4 scenario (see conformance/README.md)
└── no
    └── Does proving it need a gesture in the TUI, or a reading of the
        machine that UZE's own report cannot stand in for?
        ├── yes ──> journeys/suites/, as a scene (see journeys/README.md)
        └── no
            └── Does it exercise a public UZE flow end to end?
                ├── yes ──> tests/acceptance/
                └── no
                    └── Does it use the uze library or binary, deterministically?
                        ├── yes ──> tests/<domain>/
                        └── no  ──> a #[cfg(test)] module beside the code
```

If a test would need a credential, a network call, or an environment variable
to be meaningful, it does not belong in `tests/`.

## Domain × level matrix (as of this refactor)

| Domain | L0 | L1 | L2 | L3 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Store / packages | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ |
| Acquisition (git, containment) | ✓ | ✓ | — | partial |
| Memory / context (inspect/reconcile) | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ |
| Skills (model + discovery) | ✓ | ✓ | partial | ✓ |
| Invocation policy | ✓ | ✓ | ✓* | ✓ |
| MCP | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ |
| Lifecycle (install/remove/receipts/drift) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓* | ✓ |
| Runtime shim | ✓ | ✓ | ✓* | ✓ |
| CLI (grammar + machine) | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ |
| Marketplace | ✓ | ✓ | partial | ✓ |
| Workspace (lock/root resolution) | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ |

`✓*` = covered by the skip-if-absent real-Codex dogfood (L2 evidence when a
binary exists) or the conformance lab (partial). `partial` = covered only at some
levels or through the conformance lab, not by an in-repo test at that exact tier.

`--` = deliberately absent: the invariant is proven at a lower tier and no
real-vendor evidence exists in-repo (see the harness matrix below).

## Harness evidence matrix

| Harness | Component (L1) | Real CLI (L2) | Acceptance (L3) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Claude | ✓ | conformance lab (L2) | ✓ |
| Codex | ✓ | conformance lab (L2) | ✓ |
| OpenCode | ✓ | conformance lab (L2) | ✓ |
| Antigravity | ✓ | conformance lab (L2) | ✓ |

"conformance lab" = `conformance/` container lab L2 (offline, no credentials, runs
the real binaries) — the honest place for vendor-semantics verdicts.

## Acceptance scenarios (L3)

| Id | Scenario | Test |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | fresh machine + canonical plugin | `fresh_project::fresh_machine_installs_canonical_plugin_and_inspects_healthy` |
| A2 | fresh clone + agents.lock | `fresh_project::fresh_clone_with_lock_install_marks_environment_ready` |
| A3 | marketplace + consumer | `fresh_project::marketplace_resolution_installs_plugin_by_shorthand` |
| A4 | multi-harness projection, no duplicate delivery | `multi_harness::one_plugin_reaches_every_harness_with_no_duplicate_delivery` |
| A5 | invocation policy projection | `multi_harness::invocation_policy_projects_per_harness_classification` |
| A6 | remove lifecycle | `lifecycle::remove_lifecycle_cleans_artifacts_and_keeps_project_lock_untouched` |
| A7 | drift blocks destructive remove | `lifecycle::drift_blocks_destructive_remove_and_preserves_the_artifact` |
| A8 | runtime shim never recurses | `runtime_shim::runtime_shim_active_internal_calls_resolve_real_executable_without_recursion` |
| A9 | nested cwd → workspace root | `workspace_health::nested_cwd_resolves_workspace_root_and_installs` |
| A10 | workspace overview readiness | `workspace_health::workspace_overview_tracks_environment_readiness` |
| A11 | projection conflict honest failure | `multi_harness::projection_conflict_is_reported_honestly` |
| A12 | golden environment health (release signal) | `fresh_project::golden_environment_is_healthy` |

A12 update-lifecycle is *not* an acceptance scenario yet: update semantics
are L1 (`tests/packages/acquisition.rs` re-resolution tests) and the CLI
`update -m` is untested at L3 — that is the first gap to close
after this refactor.

## Isolation guarantees

- `TestEnvironment::isolated()` roots every path under a fresh temp dir;
  `assert_not_real_home` panics if any root could overlap `~/.uze`,
  `~/.claude`, `~/.agents`, `~/.codex`, `~/.gemini`,
  `~/.config/opencode` (or an ancestor of them).
- Child-process env is set per-`Command` (`env::command`): the test binary
  env is never mutated for L3.
- In-process `PATH`/`HOME`/cwd mutation goes through `env::scope`
  (serialized on a per-binary mutex, restored on drop — no ad hoc
  `set_var` anywhere: `grep -rn "set_var" tests/` finds only the support
  crate).
- L2 probes require the vendor binary and skip cleanly; nothing in the
  ordinary suite depends on developer-installed harnesses.
