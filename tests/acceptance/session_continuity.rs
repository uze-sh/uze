//! Acceptance: an agent relaunched into its task continues its conversation.
//!
//! Walks the public path a relaunch actually takes — the shim symlink, the
//! real `uze` binary under it, the integration's own continuity contract —
//! and reads the answer off the argv the harness was launched with, never
//! off anything UZE says about itself.
//!
//! The stand-in harness records its conversation where its vendor does, so
//! the existence check a resume makes has something real to find; a fake
//! that only echoed its argv would prove the launch and not the continuity.
//!
//! A launch UZE composes carries the agent's identity in the environment
//! (see `uze_terminal::launch`), and the shim resumes by that claim, never
//! by the directory: a launch with no identity, or one whose identity is
//! owned by an enclosing launch, is an ordinary invocation.
