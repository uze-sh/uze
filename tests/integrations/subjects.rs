//! Every registered harness, as a conformance subject.
//!
//! The subject list is built from `IntegrationRegistry::isolated` — the
//! product's own composition root — so a harness cannot be added to UZE and
//! silently skipped here. That is the whole point of this module: the
//! per-harness conformance surface used to be hand-copied, and a hand-copied
//! matrix cannot tell a deliberate exemption from a forgotten one.
//!
//! A harness with no vendor binding below fails `bindings_for` by name. A
//! harness that genuinely has no surface for a question declares
//! [`Support::NotApplicable`] with the reason, which the suite records
//! instead of quietly asserting nothing.
