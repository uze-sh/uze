# agent-work-naming Specification

## Purpose
How the work an agent does acquires the two names people read — the branch
a reviewer meets on a pull request, and the label an operator reads beside
its siblings — so that neither is a generated identifier, and neither
overwrites a name a person chose.
## Requirements
### Requirement: The work is named through a surface any harness can reach
The system SHALL provide a command, `uze agent work name <type>/<subject>`,
that an agent runs to name the work it is doing. It SHALL take no
identifier argument and SHALL name only the work of the agent running it,
inside the directory that agent's record gives it. It SHALL NOT depend on
a harness event, a launch prompt, or a vendor-specific capability, because
a name every harness can supply is the only name always available. An
agent working in the operator's checkout SHALL take the name as its label
alone, and its branch, which is the operator's, SHALL be left as it is.

#### Scenario: The task is found from inside its checkout
- **WHEN** an agent runs the naming command from anywhere inside its
  isolated checkout, including a nested directory
- **THEN** that agent's task is the one named

#### Scenario: A slot reused by successive tasks names its current owner
- **WHEN** the naming command runs in a checkout that earlier tasks also
  used
- **THEN** the task named is the running agent's, never a task that used
  to own the slot

#### Scenario: There is no task to name
- **WHEN** the command runs in a process that is not an agent UZE launched,
  or outside the directory the agent's record gives it
- **THEN** it fails saying so, and names nothing

#### Scenario: A task cannot be named from outside itself
- **WHEN** the command is run with the intent of naming a task other than
  the running agent's
- **THEN** nothing is named: one agent can never rename another's branch

#### Scenario: An agent in the operator's checkout
- **WHEN** an agent working in the operator's checkout names its work
- **THEN** its label takes the name and no branch is renamed

### Requirement: The name is asked for as the agent's first action
The projected instruction SHALL ask an agent to name its work as its first
action — before it reads a file, plans, or edits — and the naming clause
SHALL be the first thing that instruction asks for. A name states an
intention, which an agent holds from the request it was given; a moment
reached after the work has begun is one weighed against the work.

#### Scenario: Naming is the first thing the instruction asks for
- **WHEN** a project declares a branch vocabulary and its policy is
  projected
- **THEN** the naming clause is the first item of the projected region, and
  it states the moment as the agent's first action rather than as a step
  before some later one

#### Scenario: A name is accepted before the work has a commit of its own
- **WHEN** an agent names its work before writing or committing anything
- **THEN** the branch and label take that name, with no commit required for
  it to be accepted

#### Scenario: A project that names nothing asks for nothing
- **WHEN** a project declares no branch vocabulary
- **THEN** the projected instruction carries no naming clause at all

### Requirement: A name has two halves and each is read by someone different
A name SHALL be authored once as a type and a subject. The branch SHALL
carry both; the visible label SHALL carry the subject alone. The subject
SHALL be short — an intention in one or two words, not a description of
the task.

#### Scenario: One name reaches both surfaces
- **WHEN** an agent names its work `fix/branch-naming`
- **THEN** its branch is `fix/branch-naming` and its label reads `branch
  naming`

#### Scenario: The label is never the identifier once a name exists
- **WHEN** a task has been named
- **THEN** no surface shows its generated identifier in place of its name

#### Scenario: A new agent never carries the name of the task before it
- **WHEN** a new agent is placed in a slot an earlier task used, and the
  workspace has not yet read the new agent's task
- **THEN** its tab carries no name taken from the earlier task, and takes
  its own task's name once that task is read

### Requirement: The project declares the vocabulary and every name is validated against it
A project SHALL declare which branch types its names may use, as
`workspace.branch`: a named preset or its own list. A proposed name SHALL be accepted only when its
type is in that vocabulary and its subject is a well-formed single path
segment. A refusal SHALL say which half was wrong, so the next attempt is
informed rather than guessed.

#### Scenario: A name outside the vocabulary is refused
- **WHEN** an agent proposes a type the project does not declare
- **THEN** the name is refused, naming the declared vocabulary, and the
  branch is unchanged

#### Scenario: A malformed subject is refused
- **WHEN** a proposed subject is empty, carries a path separator, or is
  longer than the subject limit
- **THEN** the name is refused with that reason

#### Scenario: A name already taken is refused
- **WHEN** the proposed branch name already exists in the repository
- **THEN** the name is refused rather than silently disambiguated

#### Scenario: An undeclared vocabulary keeps today's behavior
- **WHEN** a project declares no branch vocabulary
- **THEN** branches keep the generated identifier exactly as before, and
  a naming call is refused saying the project must declare
  `workspace.branch`

### Requirement: An automatic name never overwrites a chosen one
A task's branch and label SHALL be replaced automatically only while the
branch is still in UZE's own `agent/` namespace. Once a name outside it
has been written, by the agent, by the operator, or by an earlier
automatic step, no automatic step SHALL replace it. The agent's own
naming command SHALL rename whenever it is asked, and the last name given
SHALL be the one that stands: work turns out to be something else often
enough that naming it once is not the realistic case.

#### Scenario: The generated name is replaced
- **WHEN** a task whose branch is still the generated one is named
- **THEN** the branch and label take the new name

#### Scenario: Asking again renames
- **WHEN** an agent that already named its work names it again
- **THEN** the branch and label take the second name

#### Scenario: Naming to the name already carried
- **WHEN** an agent names its work with the name its branch already has
- **THEN** the name is confirmed, nothing is refused and Git is left alone

#### Scenario: A chosen name survives the derivation
- **WHEN** a task that already carries a chosen name reaches the
  first-commit derivation
- **THEN** the existing name stands and nothing is renamed

#### Scenario: Renaming does not disturb identity
- **WHEN** a task is renamed
- **THEN** its identifier, its checkout directory and its persisted state
  are unchanged

### Requirement: The checkout's HEAD is the truth about a task's branch
The branch recorded for a task SHALL be a cache of the branch its checkout
is on, re-read whenever the task is evaluated. A branch renamed outside
UZE SHALL therefore reach every surface that reads it, and SHALL NOT leave
UZE asking Git about a branch that no longer exists.

#### Scenario: A manual rename reaches the operator's view
- **WHEN** the operator renames a task's branch inside its checkout and the
  task is evaluated
- **THEN** the sidebar, the delivery target and the sync count all read the
  new name

#### Scenario: A manual rename does not break readiness
- **WHEN** a task whose branch was renamed by hand has commits ahead of its
  base on a clean tree
- **THEN** it is reported ready and delivery is offered, rather than
  counting zero commits against a branch that no longer exists

#### Scenario: A detached head changes nothing
- **WHEN** a task's checkout is mid-rebase and on no branch
- **THEN** the recorded branch is left as it was

### Requirement: Work that reaches a commit unnamed is named from that commit
When a task's branch first carries a commit and the work still has the
name the system generated, the system SHALL name it from that commit's
subject, judged against the project's declared vocabulary. It SHALL do so
without asking any harness anything, so the behaviour is identical on
every harness. It SHALL NOT do so while the checkout is dirty or a rebase
is in progress.

#### Scenario: The first commit names the work
- **WHEN** an agent commits `feat(api): answer ping with pong` on a task
  nobody named, in a project whose vocabulary accepts `feat`
- **THEN** the branch and the label take that name

#### Scenario: A name the agent chose arrives first and wins
- **WHEN** the same task was named by its agent before the commit
- **THEN** the chosen name stands and nothing is renamed

#### Scenario: A derived name the project would refuse is not written
- **WHEN** the commit's type is not in the project's declared vocabulary
- **THEN** the work keeps the generated name, because a name UZE may not
  accept from an agent is not one it may write on its own

#### Scenario: Work in progress is left alone
- **WHEN** the checkout has uncommitted changes, or a rebase is paused
- **THEN** nothing is renamed

#### Scenario: A colliding derived name changes nothing
- **WHEN** the derived name already exists as a branch
- **THEN** the work keeps the generated name, and no error is raised —
  nobody asked for this rename

### Requirement: A published branch never carries a generated identifier
When a task's branch is published and it was never named, the system SHALL
derive a readable name from the first commit on that branch rather than
publishing the generated identifier. A task that was named SHALL be
published under its own name.

#### Scenario: A named task is published under its own name
- **WHEN** a task named `fix/chosen-by-the-agent` whose first commit would
  derive another name is delivered by publishing its branch
- **THEN** the remote holds `fix/chosen-by-the-agent`

#### Scenario: An unnamed task is published readably
- **WHEN** a task that was never named is delivered by publishing its
  branch
- **THEN** the published branch is named from its first commit's subject

#### Scenario: A published name is frozen
- **WHEN** a task's branch has already been published
- **THEN** no automatic mechanism renames it again

### Requirement: The agent surface is documented where agents read
Commands whose audience is the agent SHALL be excluded from the help a
person reads and SHALL be documented in the instruction text projected
into the project, which is the surface an agent actually reads. The
projected text SHALL name the project's own vocabulary, so the instruction
an agent reads is the one its project will accept.

#### Scenario: The human help does not carry the agent surface
- **WHEN** a person asks for help
- **THEN** the agent-facing commands are not listed among the commands a
  person is offered

#### Scenario: The projected instruction carries the vocabulary in force
- **WHEN** a project declares its branch vocabulary
- **THEN** the projected instruction names that vocabulary and the naming
  command, and it changes when the declaration changes
