# worktree-policy Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-portable-worktree-policy. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Every agent is isolated and the primary checkout belongs to the operator
The system SHALL start every agent it launches into a worktree space (see
the `space-kinds` capability) in an isolated checkout of its own, created
before the agent's process starts, without asking the operator and without
requiring any harness to cooperate. The primary checkout SHALL never be
assigned to an agent of a worktree space. Where a slot cannot be acquired
the system SHALL NOT start the agent and SHALL state the reason. An agent
of a workspace space is the operator's deliberate choice to work in the
root, and is outside this requirement.

#### Scenario: The first agent is isolated
- **WHEN** an operator creates an agent in a worktree space over a repository with no other agent running
- **THEN** it starts in an isolated checkout on its own branch, not in the primary checkout

#### Scenario: Concurrent agents never share a working tree
- **WHEN** three agents are live in one worktree space
- **THEN** each works in a distinct checkout and none of them is the primary

#### Scenario: The operator's uncommitted work is untouched by agents
- **WHEN** the operator has uncommitted changes in the primary checkout and agents of a worktree space run to completion
- **THEN** the primary checkout's working tree and index are exactly what the operator left

#### Scenario: A terminal that is not an agent runs where the operator is
- **WHEN** the operator opens a shell tab
- **THEN** it starts in the space's root and no checkout is created

#### Scenario: A harness the operator starts by hand is shown as unmanaged
- **WHEN** the operator runs a harness inside a shell tab
- **THEN** the tab is listed with the harness's name and its real directory, and carries no task, checkout, state or delivery action
- **AND** nothing is evaluated for it

#### Scenario: A slot that cannot be acquired refuses the launch
- **WHEN** an agent is created in a worktree space and no slot can be acquired for it
- **THEN** no agent starts in the space's root
- **AND** the operator is told why

### Requirement: Isolated checkouts are reusable slots
The system SHALL keep isolated checkouts under the primary checkout's fixed
isolation directory, each named by a generated identifier that never
changes, and SHALL reuse a free checkout for a new agent before creating
another. Reuse SHALL put the working tree at the task's base with no tracked
or untracked file from the previous task, and SHALL preserve ignored files.
A checkout holding uncommitted changes, or commits absent from its base,
SHALL never be reused; uncommitted changes confined to content the system
derives are not work (`checkout-accounting`). A checkout in which any
process is working SHALL never be reused. The number of checkouts SHALL be bounded by peak
concurrency, and a project MAY declare a cap.

#### Scenario: A free checkout is reused
- **WHEN** a task ends with its checkout clean and a new agent is created
- **THEN** the new agent starts in that checkout, on a new branch from the base
- **AND** ignored files such as build caches remain in place

#### Scenario: A previous task's edits never reach the next
- **WHEN** a checkout whose last task was delivered is reused
- **THEN** the working tree matches the base and carries none of the previous branch's edits

#### Scenario: A checkout holding work is never reused
- **WHEN** a task's agent is gone and its checkout has uncommitted changes or commits absent from its base
- **THEN** the checkout is parked, listed to the operator, and not offered to a new agent

#### Scenario: A slot whose work was squash-merged is free again
- **WHEN** a task's work reached the target as a squash or a rebase merge, so none of the branch's own commits is reachable from it, and the agent is gone
- **THEN** the checkout is free and the next agent is placed in it rather than in a new one

#### Scenario: A reused slot answers for its new task alone
- **WHEN** a new agent is placed in a checkout that earlier tasks ran in, and the record of one of them still reads as live
- **THEN** only the new task holds that checkout
- **AND** each earlier task ends by what its own branch holds, and keeps that branch

#### Scenario: A worktree the system did not create is not a slot
- **WHEN** a harness, an agent or an operator creates a worktree without the system's record, anywhere — inside the isolation directory, or a harness's own isolation started from inside an agent's checkout
- **THEN** it is never adopted as a slot, offered to an agent, swept as idle or removed, and its branch is never pruned
- **AND** nothing the system projects forbids it: work on another branch is the agent's to bring back to its own

#### Scenario: A new checkout is created only when none is free
- **WHEN** every existing checkout is occupied or parked
- **THEN** a new checkout is created

#### Scenario: A declared cap holds
- **WHEN** a project declares a maximum number of checkouts and all are occupied
- **THEN** no new agent is started until one is free, and the operator is told why

### Requirement: Nothing that can hold work is removed automatically
The system SHALL NOT remove a working tree holding uncommitted changes, nor
a branch holding commits absent from its target, on any automatic path.
Whether a branch's work is in the target SHALL be answered by what the
target carries and not by commit identity alone: every commit reachable
from it, or the same patch present under commits of its own, as a squash
merge and a rebase merge each leave it. A branch whose work is in the
target MAY be removed, as MAY the directory of a free checkout
beyond the spare slots `checkout-accounting` keeps, while keeping its
branch. A checkout in which any process is working SHALL NOT be removed. Discarding work SHALL happen only on an explicit operator
action naming the task.

#### Scenario: A dirty orphan is parked, not deleted
- **WHEN** startup finds a checkout with uncommitted changes and no live agent
- **THEN** the checkout is parked and every file in it is preserved

#### Scenario: An unintegrated branch outlives its checkout
- **WHEN** a clean checkout is idle beyond the declared age and its branch has commits absent from the target
- **THEN** the directory may be removed and the branch remains

#### Scenario: An integrated branch is pruned
- **WHEN** every commit of a task's branch is reachable from the target
- **THEN** the branch may be removed without an operator action

#### Scenario: A squash-merged branch still counts as integrated
- **WHEN** a branch's work is merged by squashing, so none of its commits is reachable from the target
- **THEN** the branch is read as integrated from the patch the target carries, without asking any forge, and may be pruned
- **AND** the same holds for a rebase merge, which keeps every commit under a new identity

#### Scenario: Only the operator discards
- **WHEN** a parked task is discarded
- **THEN** the action was taken by the operator on that task, and no automatic path could have taken it

### Requirement: A task's identity is immutable and its name is derived
The system SHALL give every agent launch a generated task identifier that
never changes, and SHALL key the checkout and the task's persisted state on
it. The branch SHALL start from that identifier under the `agent/` prefix,
and both the branch and the visible label SHALL then be names rather than
derivations: replaced once while they are still generated, never overwritten
afterwards (see the `agent-work-naming` capability). A readable name derived
at publish time SHALL remain as the fallback for a task nobody named, not as
the mechanism by which work is named. Task state SHALL be persisted outside
every checkout and written atomically.

#### Scenario: The branch starts from the identifier
- **WHEN** an agent is created
- **THEN** its branch is the identifier under the `agent/` prefix, and its
  label is the generated one until the work is named

#### Scenario: A published branch carries a readable name
- **WHEN** a task nobody named is delivered by opening a pull request
- **THEN** the pushed branch is named from the task's first commit
- **AND** the task's identifier, checkout and state are unchanged

#### Scenario: State survives the checkout
- **WHEN** a task's checkout directory is removed
- **THEN** the task's state and transcript are still available

#### Scenario: An interrupted write leaves a valid state file
- **WHEN** the process is killed while task state is being written
- **THEN** the state file on disk is either the previous version or the new one, never truncated

### Requirement: Readiness is observed, never declared
The system SHALL decide whether a task is ready to deliver from the state of
its checkout: ready when its branch has commits absent from the base and the
working tree is clean. It SHALL evaluate that state when the agent's pane
goes quiet and whenever the operator asks, and SHALL NOT rely on the agent
announcing completion. An end-of-turn signal from a harness, where one is
delivered, MAY trigger an evaluation but SHALL NOT be required.

#### Scenario: Commits and a clean tree read as ready
- **WHEN** the agent's pane goes quiet with commits on the task's branch and a clean working tree
- **THEN** the task is reported ready and delivery is offered

#### Scenario: Uncommitted changes are surfaced, not delivered
- **WHEN** the agent's pane goes quiet with uncommitted changes in the task's checkout
- **THEN** the tab reports uncommitted work and delivery is not offered

#### Scenario: A quiet pane that resumes is not stuck as ready
- **WHEN** a task was reported ready and its agent produces further changes
- **THEN** the next evaluation reflects the checkout's current state

### Requirement: An agent is placed on the target as the remote has it
The system SHALL bring the local target in line with the remote's before
cutting a new agent's branch from it, by fast-forward and by nothing else.
A target carrying commits the remote lacks, and one Git refuses to move
because the primary checkout has work in the way, SHALL be left exactly as
they stand, and the placement SHALL report how far behind the agent starts.
A repository with no remote, or whose target the remote does not have, SHALL
be placed from its local target with nothing to report.

#### Scenario: A new agent starts from what the remote has
- **WHEN** the remote's target has moved since this machine last fetched and an agent is created
- **THEN** the local target is fast-forwarded onto the remote's tip and the agent's branch is cut from there

#### Scenario: The operator's own commits are never rewritten to sync
- **WHEN** the local target carries commits the remote does not and the remote has moved
- **THEN** the local target is left where it stands, the agent is placed from it, and the placement says how far behind the target is

#### Scenario: A repository with no remote is placed from its own target
- **WHEN** an agent is created in a repository with no remote
- **THEN** the agent is placed from the local target and nothing is reported

### Requirement: Delivery follows the declared completion and only the system writes the target
The system SHALL deliver a ready task only on an explicit operator action,
one task at a time, never while one of its subagents' checkouts holds work
not yet joined (`checkout-accounting`), according to the project's declared completion
behavior. `handoff` SHALL leave the branch for the operator. `merge` SHALL
rebase the task's branch onto the target's tip inside the task's checkout,
run the project's declared gate on the rebased commits, and advance the
target by fast-forward only. `pr` SHALL publish the branch under its
readable name and open a pull request against the target. No agent SHALL
write the target branch; the system SHALL write it only in the fast-forward
step. The target's tip SHALL be taken from where the target lives: the
remote-tracking branch after a fetch when delivery publishes a pull
request, the local branch otherwise. Delivery SHALL NOT update the
operator's checked-out target except in the fast-forward step of `merge`;
the only other write to it is the fast-forward that brings it in line with
the remote before an agent is placed.

#### Scenario: Handoff never touches the target
- **WHEN** the operator delivers a ready task in a project declaring handoff
- **THEN** the branch is reported as ready for the operator and the target is unchanged

#### Scenario: Merge advances the target linearly after the gate
- **WHEN** the operator delivers a ready task in a project declaring merge
- **THEN** the branch is rebased onto the target, the gate passes on the rebased commits, and the target moves to the branch's tip
- **AND** the target's history is linear

#### Scenario: A gate failure leaves the target untouched
- **WHEN** the gate fails on the rebased commits
- **THEN** the task is returned to its agent with the gate's output and the target is unchanged

#### Scenario: A conflict is returned to the agent that owns the task
- **WHEN** the rebase stops on conflicts
- **THEN** the rebase stays paused in the task's checkout, the agent is told which files conflict and how far the target moved, and the target is unchanged
- **AND** the next evaluation reads the task's state from its checkout

#### Scenario: The second task sees the first
- **WHEN** two ready tasks are delivered in sequence
- **THEN** the second is rebased onto a target that already contains the first

#### Scenario: Overlapping uncommitted work in the primary refuses delivery
- **WHEN** the operator has uncommitted changes in the primary checkout to files the task changed
- **THEN** delivery in merge mode is refused and reported, and nothing is written

#### Scenario: In pr mode the target is the remote's
- **WHEN** a task is rebased or delivered in a project declaring pr and the remote target has moved
- **THEN** the branch is rebased onto the remote target's tip as fetched
- **AND** delivery does not modify the operator's local target branch or primary checkout

#### Scenario: Sibling tasks share work only through the target
- **WHEN** one task has been delivered and another live task asks for the target
- **THEN** the second task receives the first's work by rebasing onto the target
- **AND** no task's branch ever carries another task's commits directly, save a subagent's checkout joined into its own agent (`checkout-accounting`)

#### Scenario: A live task follows the target automatically
- **WHEN** the target has moved and a live task's pane goes quiet with a clean working tree
- **THEN** the task's branch is rebased onto the target's tip inside its checkout, under the same rules as delivery
- **AND** a conflict is returned to the agent and the target is unchanged
- **AND** this holds under every completion behavior, from the local target and without a fetch of its own

#### Scenario: Work the target already holds is delivered, not replayed
- **WHEN** a live task's work reached the target as a squash or a rebase merge, so the target moved but none of the branch's commits is reachable from it
- **THEN** the task is read as integrated from the patch the target carries
- **AND** its branch is not rebased, nothing is returned to its agent, and its checkout is left as the agent left it

#### Scenario: Work after a delivery is moved alone
- **WHEN** an agent keeps committing on a branch whose earlier work reached the target as a squash or a rebase merge, and the target moves
- **THEN** only the commits made after the delivery are rebased onto the target
- **AND** the task counts only those commits as what is left to deliver

#### Scenario: A request number answers for its own branch
- **WHEN** the branch a task is published under changes, or the task takes on new work after a delivery
- **THEN** the request number recorded for the earlier branch or work is dropped, and the remote is asked again for the current one

#### Scenario: A task mid-edit is not rebased under its agent
- **WHEN** the target has moved while a live task's working tree is dirty
- **THEN** the task is left as it is until its tree is clean and its pane quiet

#### Scenario: A pull request targets the declared branch
- **WHEN** the operator delivers a ready task in a project declaring pr
- **THEN** the branch is pushed under its readable name and a pull request against the target is opened

### Requirement: Existing checkouts are adopted at startup
The system SHALL reconcile the isolation directory, the `agent/` branches
and its persisted task state when a repository's space starts. A checkout
is taken as the system's own only as `checkout-accounting` states: by the
record it carries, or on sight when a launched agent's record names it or
it bears a legacy `agent-<n>` name. A checkout without a record SHALL NOT
be adopted by inference, whatever its name or place; it is listed to the
operator. A task without a checkout SHALL be marked from where its branch
stands. Stale worktree registry entries SHALL be pruned only after
reconciliation.

#### Scenario: A legacy checkout is adopted
- **WHEN** the isolation directory holds checkouts named `agent-<n>`, created before task state existed
- **THEN** each is adopted as a task labelled from its branch, and no branch is renamed

#### Scenario: A checkout nobody recorded is not adopted
- **WHEN** the isolation directory holds a worktree without the system's record, not named `agent-<n>`, and no launched agent's record names it
- **THEN** it is not adopted, and it is listed to the operator

#### Scenario: Prune never runs before adoption
- **WHEN** startup finds a registry entry whose directory is gone
- **THEN** the entry is pruned only after every remaining checkout has been adopted

### Requirement: The declaration is projected without triggering foreign isolation
The system SHALL render a project's declaration into a marker-owned managed
region of the shared instruction file, stating the isolation layout, that a
reader inside an isolated checkout is already isolated and commits on its
own branch and never on the target, that a reader anywhere else in the
project is on the operator's branch and commits there without switching,
resetting or stashing it, that delivery is performed by the system for
isolated work, and that a subagent's checkout is asked for, joined and
listed through the agent's `work` verbs rather than made with Git.
The rendering SHALL be deterministic, and SHALL NOT instruct any reader to
create a top-level worktree.

#### Scenario: Reconciling a declaration projects it
- **WHEN** the operator reconciles project context for a project that declares an isolation policy
- **THEN** the shared instruction file carries the declaration in a managed region
- **AND** a second reconciliation changes no bytes

#### Scenario: A project declaring nothing carries no region
- **WHEN** the operator reconciles project context for a project that declares no isolation policy
- **THEN** no region is written and none is reported

#### Scenario: The projection does not activate a harness's own worktree mechanism
- **WHEN** the projected text is read by a harness that creates worktrees when instructed to
- **THEN** it finds no instruction to create a top-level worktree
- **AND** it is told it is already isolated

#### Scenario: The projected text keeps the target for the system
- **WHEN** a project declares any completion behavior
- **THEN** the projected text states that behavior, that an isolated reader commits on its own branch, and that the target is written by the system

#### Scenario: The projected text addresses the reader on the operator's branch
- **WHEN** the projected text is read by an agent standing in the project's root rather than in an isolated checkout
- **THEN** it is told it is on the operator's branch, to commit there, and never to switch, reset or stash it

### Requirement: A declaration stays editable
The system SHALL key the projected region's identity on the rendered
content, so changing the declaration supersedes one region and creates
another rather than drifting the existing one. A region edited by hand SHALL
be reported as drifted and left untouched.

#### Scenario: Editing the declaration replaces its region
- **WHEN** a project's declaration changes and context is reconciled
- **THEN** the superseded region is removed and the new one attached
- **AND** exactly one region remains

#### Scenario: An edited region is refused, not rewritten
- **WHEN** the region's content has been changed by hand
- **THEN** reconciliation reports drift and leaves the file's bytes untouched

### Requirement: The workspace client shows the policy in effect and where it came from
The agent context popup SHALL name the completion behavior, the delivery
target and the gate command in force for the repository, and SHALL state
whether they come from the project's manifest or from the built-in
default. A policy that has never been declared SHALL read as the default,
not as absent.

#### Scenario: An undeclared policy reads as the default, attributed
- **WHEN** the popup opens in a repository whose manifest declares no
  policy
- **THEN** it shows the default completion behavior, attributed to the
  default rather than to the project

#### Scenario: A declared policy is attributed to the manifest
- **WHEN** the popup opens in a repository declaring `pr`
- **THEN** it shows `pr`, attributed to `agents.yaml`

### Requirement: Changing the policy from the popup is an explicit, versioned edit
The popup SHALL let the completion behavior be changed directly, and that
change SHALL write the project's manifest. Because the manifest is a
tracked file whose policy is projected into `AGENTS.md`, the popup SHALL
say so before writing — naming the file it will change and the
reconciliation the change still needs — rather than editing a tracked
file silently.

#### Scenario: Changing the behavior writes the manifest
- **WHEN** a completion behavior is chosen in the popup
- **THEN** `agents.yaml` records it, created first if the project had none

#### Scenario: The consequence is stated before the write
- **WHEN** a completion behavior is chosen
- **THEN** the popup names the file being changed and that `AGENTS.md`
  needs reconciliation to carry the new text

#### Scenario: The projected text is not silently left stale
- **WHEN** the policy has changed and `AGENTS.md` still carries the
  previous projection
- **THEN** the workspace client reports the projection as out of date

### Requirement: A policy change binds tasks created after it
A policy change SHALL apply to tasks created after it. A task already
running SHALL keep the policy it was launched under, because its agent is
reading the projected text that policy produced.

#### Scenario: A running agent keeps its launch policy
- **WHEN** the completion behavior changes while a task is live
- **THEN** that task is delivered the way it was launched, and the popup
  shows the running task's behavior alongside the new project default

#### Scenario: The next task takes the new policy
- **WHEN** a task is created after the change
- **THEN** it is delivered the new way
