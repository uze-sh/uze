## 1. Manifest and model

- [x] 1.1 Add `requirements: [{ executable, version?, purpose? }]` to the canonical `plugin.json` schema in `uze-core`; validate at discovery (name required, version constraint parseable); document the field as an extension of the `agent-plugins.org` manifest
- [x] 1.2 Model `Requirement` and the package's effective set: declared entries plus entries contributed by generated artifacts, each attributed to its source (author / artifact)
- [x] 1.3 Unit tests: valid/malformed declarations; effective set merges duplicates by executable and keeps the strictest version constraint

## 2. Detection (read-only)

- [x] 2.1 Implement detection in `uze-core::machine`: `PATH` lookup plus a version probe with a per-executable table (flag and parse format) and a deadline; only an executable that answers is present (Windows App Execution Aliases and the macOS `python3` stub are missing); unknown format reports "present, version unknown"
- [x] 2.2 Requirement status read model per package: met / too old / missing, with the closing command when an installer is known
- [x] 2.3 `uze status -m` and `uze inspect` show requirement status per package; `uze doctor` re-verifies every installed package's effective set and reports unmet/drifted requirements (UZE installs no tool, so none is ever orphaned)
- [x] 2.4 Tests with a fake `PATH` (present, absent, too old); classify any new CLI leaf in `command_performance.rs`

## 3. Suggestion and surfaces

- [x] 3.1 Suggestion in `uze-core::machine`: package-manager detection in preference order (user-level manager in use → `brew` → system manager → `winget`), executable → package-name table per manager, rendered command with `sudo` where the manager needs it, manual-fallback text when no row applies; nothing is executed
- [x] 3.2 Requirement report read model from install/update/doctor: per package, each requirement met / too old / missing with purpose and suggested command
- [x] 3.3 CLI: print the report after `install`/`update` (gaps only), in `status -m`, `inspect` and `doctor`
- [x] 3.4 TUI: show unmet requirements as an issue on the package in the manage view; "open in shell" opens a terminal tab through the terminal runtime with the command pre-filled and not executed; re-check on tab close/refresh and clear the issue when the executable is found
- [x] 3.5 Tests: suggestion table per manager; report rendering; install completes with the gap reported; TUI view/handoff through the extension host with no domain reach (architecture suite stays zero-debt)

## 4. Integrations contribute their requirements

- [x] 4.1 Integrations declare the requirements of the artifacts they generate; the `sh` hook wrapper (from `native-first-hooks`) contributes `jq` attributed to the wrapper
- [x] 4.3 Exec-form hook handlers contribute their launcher's interpreter attributed to the hook (`hook-exec-form`); a fail-closed source escalates the report line
- [x] 4.2 Test: a package with hooks and no declared requirements shows `jq` as required by the wrapper on Claude/Codex/Antigravity and nothing on OpenCode

## 5. Conformance and docs

- [x] 5.1 Fixture: a marketplace plugin declaring a requirement; one vertical proves the unmet report when the tool is absent and the hook wrapper's fail-closed behaviour in that state
- [x] 5.2 Docs: `docs/capabilities/portable-hooks.md` `jq` note points to requirements; plugin authoring docs describe `requirements`; `uze doctor` docs list the new report
- [ ] 5.3 Full gate: `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --no-fail-fast`, `openspec validate --all --strict`
