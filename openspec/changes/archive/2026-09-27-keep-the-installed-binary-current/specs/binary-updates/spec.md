## Purpose

How an installed `uze` learns that a newer release exists, replaces itself
when it is the binary the installer placed, and tells the operator what
happened — without ever replacing a binary something else installed.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Only the installer's binary is replaced

The installer SHALL record the file it placed and the release it was. UZE
SHALL replace a binary only when the running binary is that recorded file, and
SHALL NOT replace a binary running from any other path, whatever installed it.

#### Scenario: A binary the installer placed

- **WHEN** the running `uze` is the file the installer recorded and a newer
  release is published
- **THEN** that file is replaced with the newer release, and the record names
  the newer release

#### Scenario: A binary something else placed

- **WHEN** the running `uze` is not the file the installer recorded — or no
  record exists — and a newer release is published
- **THEN** no file is replaced, and `uze upgrade` tells the operator the
  newer release exists and why this binary was not replaced

### Requirement: A replacement is verified before it is placed

UZE SHALL verify a downloaded release against the published checksums, SHALL
run the binary it contains and confirm it reports the release it was
downloaded as, and SHALL leave the installed file untouched when either check
fails. The replacement SHALL be a single rename on the installed file's own
filesystem, so no process can start a partially written binary.

#### Scenario: A checksum that does not match

- **WHEN** the downloaded archive's digest differs from the published one
- **THEN** the installed binary is unchanged and no notice claims an update

#### Scenario: A binary that is not the release it claims

- **WHEN** the unpacked binary does not report the release it was downloaded as
- **THEN** the installed binary is unchanged

### Requirement: What is running is never interrupted by an update

Replacing the installed binary SHALL NOT stop, restart or signal any running
process. The new release SHALL first run at the next launch.

#### Scenario: An update lands with the workspace open

- **WHEN** the binary is replaced while the terminal workspace is open
- **THEN** the open workspace and every pane in it continue unaffected, and
  the sidebar says the update is installed and takes effect on restart

### Requirement: The workspace sidebars announce releases

Both sidebars SHALL show, above the sections at their foot, a notice for an
update that was installed and is not yet running, and for nothing else: a
release that is only available, or that this binary will not install
itself, is not announced there — `uze upgrade` is where a person asks, and
where the reason is told. The notice SHALL name the version and SHALL
keep its dismissal visible at any sidebar width. Activating the notice SHALL
open that release's notes — its own section of the `CHANGELOG.md` published
at its tag, and no other release's — in a modal inside the client, from
which the release page can be opened; dismissing it
SHALL put away the notice for that release in every client and every later
run.

#### Scenario: A release this binary will not install

- **WHEN** a newer release is published and the running binary is not the
  one a receipt names
- **THEN** neither sidebar shows a notice

#### Scenario: Opening the notes

- **WHEN** the operator activates the notice's row
- **THEN** a modal opens on the notes of the version it names, rendered
  rather than shown as Markdown, and shows no other release

#### Scenario: Notes that cannot be read

- **WHEN** the changelog cannot be fetched, or does not carry the release
- **THEN** the modal says so and still opens the release page on request

#### Scenario: Dismissing it

- **WHEN** the operator dismisses the notice
- **THEN** it disappears from both sidebars and does not return for that
  release

### Requirement: A CLI command never waits on a release check

A CLI command SHALL NOT perform network access to check for releases. When the
last answer is stale it SHALL hand the check to a separate process and return.
A command whose reader is a person at a terminal SHALL mention a given release
at most once, after its own output and on stderr, and only when it succeeded.
Commands whose reader is an agent, a hook or the terminal server SHALL NOT
mention releases.

#### Scenario: A stale answer

- **WHEN** a CLI command finishes and the last release check is over an hour
  old
- **THEN** the command returns without waiting, and a separate process asks
  for the latest release

#### Scenario: A release already mentioned

- **WHEN** a release was already mentioned by an earlier command
- **THEN** later commands say nothing about it

### Requirement: The operator can turn it off

UZE SHALL stop checking when told to, SHALL check without replacing when told
to, and SHALL NOT check at all in continuous integration unless told to.

#### Scenario: Turned off

- **WHEN** `UZE_AUTOUPDATE` is `off`
- **THEN** no release is asked for, replaced or announced

#### Scenario: Notify only

- **WHEN** `UZE_AUTOUPDATE` is `notify`
- **THEN** a newer release is never installed automatically, and
  `uze upgrade` still installs it when asked

#### Scenario: In CI

- **WHEN** `CI` is set and `UZE_AUTOUPDATE` is not
- **THEN** no release is asked for

### Requirement: `uze upgrade` is the one verb for the binary

The system SHALL provide `uze upgrade`: it asks for the newest release now
and replaces the binary under the rules above, rather than waiting for a
background pass, and reports what it did.

It SHALL be the *only* name for that operation. The background check a CLI
command hands to a detached process SHALL be this same command under a
hidden flag, not a second verb — two spellings of one operation is what
ADR-019 refused, and `self-update` beside `upgrade` would be exactly that.

`upgrade` names the binary and nothing else. It sits at the root beside
`setup`, `doctor` and `theme`, which are about the tool rather than about
a project or about `~/.uze/*` package state — the category ADR-019's
machine-level namespaces (`market`, `plugin`, `harness`) do not cover.

#### Scenario: Asking for a release now
- **WHEN** `uze upgrade` is run from a binary a receipt names and a newer
  release is published
- **THEN** that release is verified and placed, and the command reports the
  version it installed and that a restart picks it up

#### Scenario: Already current
- **WHEN** `uze upgrade` is run and the running binary is the newest release
- **THEN** it reports that nothing was to be done, and replaces nothing

#### Scenario: A binary no receipt names
- **WHEN** `uze upgrade` is run from a binary the installer did not place
- **THEN** nothing is replaced, and the command reports the newer release and
  where the running binary came from

#### Scenario: The background pass is the same command
- **WHEN** an ordinary command hands a stale release answer to a detached
  process
- **THEN** that process is `uze upgrade` under a hidden flag, and no second
  release-checking verb exists

#### Scenario: It touches no plugin
- **WHEN** `uze upgrade` runs
- **THEN** no package in the Store, no `agents.yaml` and no `agents.lock` is
  modified by it
