## 1. The name and what validates it

- [x] 1.1 `worktree::BranchVocabulary` (now in `crates/uze-workspace`) —
  a preset (`conventional`, `gitflow`, `flat`, `agent`), a project's own
  list, or `Unset`, deserialized from one `worktrees.branch` key that
  accepts either form. A preset is a named
  list; validation does not know which spelling it came from.
- [x] 1.2 `BranchVocabulary::accept`, refusing with a `NameRefusal` — the type is in the vocabulary, the
  subject is one well-formed segment (lowercase, `[a-z0-9-]`, no separator,
  bounded length, no double hyphen). It returns *which half* failed: a
  refusal an agent cannot act on is a refusal it will retry wrong.
- [x] 1.3 The label is the subject with hyphens as spaces. One derivation,
  in Core, so the sidebar and the branch cannot disagree about what a name
  means.
- [x] 1.4 `WorktreePolicy` carries the vocabulary and `deny_unknown_fields`
  still holds; an undeclared `branch:` resolves to `Unset`, which names no
  work, like `agent`: today's behavior exactly.

## 2. Naming a task

- [x] 2.1 `Task` gains no field: `branch` and `label` already exist and
  become writable. The one predicate is `Agent::is_named`: the branch sits
  outside UZE's `agent/` namespace.
- [x] 2.2 `Workspace::name_task` (`uze-application`,
  `services/tasks/naming.rs`) — find the running agent's record for the
  directory it runs in, validate, rename with `checkout::rename_branch`
  under the task store's lock, persist, and retarget its subagents. Refuses
  when the branch exists and when the checkout is not on the task's branch
  (mid-rebase). Asking again renames; naming to the current name is
  confirmed. An agent in the operator's checkout takes the name as its
  label alone (`label_in_place`).
- [x] 2.3 "Unnamed" is one predicate in one place, `Agent::is_named`, which
  the automatic derivation asks rather than inventing its own.

## 3. The checkout's HEAD is the truth

- [x] 3.1 `evaluate_tasks` re-reads `current_branch` for each live task's
  checkout and adopts it when it differs and is not detached. This is the
  fix for the real defect: a hand-renamed branch makes
  `commits_ahead` answer `0` through its `unwrap_or`, so the task never
  reaches `Ready` and delivery is never offered.
- [x] 3.2 `checkout::prune_integrated_branches` (`checkout/lifecycle.rs`) stops assuming the `agent/`
  prefix: it scans the prefix *and* the branches the task store names, or a
  renamed branch is never collected.
- [x] 3.3 `reconcile`'s adoption of an unrecorded checkout takes the branch
  as it finds it, pinned by
  `checkout::tests::a_checkout_on_a_named_branch_is_adopted_under_its_name`.
  Writing it found the label half wrong: a named branch was labelled with
  the slot's identifier, which "the label is never the identifier once a
  name exists" forbids; it now reads from the name.

## 4. The agent surface

- [x] 4.1 `uze agent work name <type>/<subject>` — `Command::Agent` with a
  `work` noun (`AgentWorkAction::Name`), `hide = true`, project-scoped. No identifier argument: one
  agent must not be able to rename another's branch.
- [x] 4.2 Classify it in `command_performance.rs`. It is `Budgeted` (a task
  store read, a validation, one Git rename) — and check
  `every_cli_command_is_classified` treats a hidden nested leaf the way this
  assumes before relying on it.
- [x] 4.3 The refusal messages are written for a model: they name the
  vocabulary in force and the exact command form. This is the only feedback
  channel a denied agent has.

## 5. The automatic half (replaces enforcement by hook)

Planned as a `PreToolUse` `deny` shipped in a plugin. Built, and then
removed, for three reasons found by building it — each recorded here
rather than in a commit nobody reads:

- **It could not cover the four.** OpenCode claims `observe`/`allow` only,
  and `assess` routes an unpreservable `deny` as `Unsupported` rather than
  degrading it — correctly, since a denial that became an observation would
  be worse than none. The mechanism proposed to answer "funcione sempre"
  did not.
- **It cost a trust decision.** A Hook is an executable capability, and the
  default plugin is bootstrapped onto every machine with `NoTrustAuthority`
  — measured: `TRUST_REQUIRED` refuses the package outright. Shipping it
  separately made enforcement a second install and a prompt.
- **Its handler depended on `uze`.** ADR-040 removed the binary from the
  hook execution path deliberately; the handler put it back. Removable in
  principle — the namespace predicate is answerable from Git alone — but
  the dependency should never have been written.

- [x] 5.1 `landing::derived_name` — the branch's first commit subject,
  split into a Conventional type and a subject, **judged against the
  project's vocabulary**. A derived name the project would refuse from an
  agent is not one UZE may write behind its back.
- [x] 5.2 `evaluate_tasks` applies it at `Ready` and nowhere else: commits
  ahead, a clean tree, no rebase in progress
  (`EvaluationPass::name_from_the_work`). Naming a branch under an agent
  mid-edit is what that gate exists to avoid.
- [x] 5.3 The agent's own name arrives earlier and therefore wins: the
  derivation asks `is_named` and leaves a chosen name alone.
- [x] 5.4 A derived name that collides with an existing branch leaves the
  branch as it was, silently — nobody asked for this rename, so it cannot
  be worth an error.
- [x] 5.5 The projected clause says the automatic half exists and that it
  produces a worse name than a deliberate one, so an agent has a reason to
  name its own work rather than a rule it is told to follow.

## 6. The fallback nothing should need

- [x] 6.1 `landing::readable_branch_name` is re-sourced from the first
  commit's subject on the task's branch, not from the label. Conventional
  type becomes the segment where the subject carries one; otherwise the
  project's vocabulary decides.
- [x] 6.2 It never renames a branch already published: `published_as`
  freezes the remote name. (Applying it only to a task nobody named is not
  done; see proposal, Not in this change.)

## 7. Projection

- [x] 7.1 `WorktreePolicy::instructions()` gains the naming clause, naming
  the command and *this project's* vocabulary — so the instruction an agent
  reads is the one its project will accept. `region_identity()` is a digest
  of these bytes, so a vocabulary change re-projects on its own.
- [x] 7.2 The clause tells the agent to ask Git for its branch rather than
  remember it, because the name can change under it.
- [x] 7.3 Depends on `project-agent-environment` §12: a policy that does not
  reach the projected region is a policy agents never read.
- [x] 7.4 The clause states the **moment**, not only the command: the
  agent's first action, before it reads a file, plans or edits. Projected
  as the region's *first* bullet — the bullets are read in order, and a
  request placed after three rules about commits and rebases reads as
  something to do later.
- [x] 7.5 The same moment in the two other places the rule is written: the
  `worktree` skill in `plugins/uze` (which never mentioned naming at all)
  and the `worktrees.branch` comment in this repository's own
  `agents.yaml`. One rule stated three times is three chances to state it
  differently, so they are worded from the same sentence.
- [x] 7.6 A project that names nothing projects no naming clause at all.

## 8. Tests

The same invariant at more than one level is deliberate here (`tests/README.md`):
the naming rule is a pure function at L0, a lifecycle at L1, and a user's
flow at L3.5 — and each catches a different way of being wrong.

- [x] 8.0 **L0 — the moment** (`uze-workspace` `worktree.rs`, `#[cfg(test)]`): the first bullet
  of the projected region is the naming clause and it states the first
  action; the old moment's wording appears nowhere in the region. A rule
  whose whole weight is *when* it is read is one a test has to read
  positionally.
- [x] 8.1 **L0 — validation and derivation** (`uze-workspace` `worktree.rs`, `#[cfg(test)]`):
  every preset accepts its own types and refuses the others; a project list
  behaves identically to a preset of the same members; a malformed subject
  is refused per half (empty, separator, over-length, double hyphen, upper
  case); the label derivation is the inverse of the subject spelling.
- [x] 8.2 **L0 — the predicate**
  (`task.rs::only_a_branch_outside_uzes_namespace_reads_as_named`): a
  branch inside `agent/` reads as unnamed, one outside it as named.
- [x] 8.3 **L1 — naming a task** (`uze-application`,
  `services/tasks/tests.rs`): naming from a nested directory names the
  checkout's own task; a process that is not the agent has nothing to
  name; an agent in the root takes the name as its label alone; naming
  again renames and the last name stands; the current name is confirmed;
  a name colliding with an existing branch, or outside the vocabulary, is
  refused and the branch is untouched.
- [x] 8.4 **L1 — the HEAD is the truth** (`uze-application`,
  `services/tasks/tests.rs`): a branch renamed with Git outside UZE is
  adopted by the next evaluation and still reaches `Ready` (the regression
  test for the `unwrap_or(0)` defect).
- [x] 8.5 **L1 — delivery and collection** (`uze-workspace`
  `landing/tests.rs`, `checkout/naming_collection_tests.rs`): an unnamed
  task publishes under the name derived from its first commit; a published
  branch is re-delivered under the same name; `prune_integrated_branches`
  collects a renamed, integrated branch that no longer carries the
  `agent/` prefix and leaves a live one alone.
- [x] 8.6 **L1 — the automatic half** (`uze-application`): a first commit
  names unnamed work; a name the agent chose is never replaced; a commit
  outside the vocabulary names nothing; a project declaring no vocabulary is
  left alone; a dirty checkout is not named; a colliding name leaves the
  branch as it was.
- [x] 8.7 **L0 — projection** (`uze-workspace` `worktree.rs`, not `tests/projection/`): the
  projected region carries the declared vocabulary, and changing the
  vocabulary changes the region's identity — both written. The third claim,
  that two machines with the same declaration project the same bytes, is
  **not written**: `add-portable-worktree-policy` §10.4 already pins it for
  the policy as a whole, and the vocabulary rides in the same bytes.
- [x] 8.8 **UI (`src/ui/`, `TestBackend`)**: the sidebar renders the label
  and the adopted branch, and a long name is elided rather than cut. This is
  where a claim about what the screen *says* belongs — a journey may only
  gate on screen text, never assert it.
- [x] 8.9 **L3 — acceptance** (`tests/acceptance/agent_surface.rs`): through the real
  binary, `uze agent work name` in a placed agent's checkout renames the
  branch and the recorded label, and the command is absent from `uze --help`
  while still working — the pair that proves "hidden" means hidden from the
  person, not disabled.
- [x] 8.10 **L3.5 — journey**, `journeys/suites/04-workspace/03-naming-the-work.yml`, a new file
  rather than a scene on `01-agents-and-slots`: it needs a world of its own
  (a manifest declaring a vocabulary), and its claim does not depend on that
  story. Scenes: an agent is placed and its branch is the generated one;
  the agent names its work and `git` in the checkout reports the new branch
  while the task store records the same name and the slot directory is
  unchanged; naming it again renames it; the operator renames the branch by hand and the next evaluation
  records *that* name, unchanged by anything automatic. Every `then` reads
  Git, the filesystem or the task store — never UZE's own report; screen
  text appears only as `expect`. Tagged `gate`.
- [x] 8.11 **L3.5 — journey**, `journeys/suites/05-delivery/03-a-branch-nobody-named.yml`: a task
  nobody named is delivered, and the branch the remote receives carries a
  readable name rather than the identifier — read from the bare remote with
  Git, not from UZE's delivery report. A separate file from 8.10: different
  world, different cadence, and a shared file would mean a shared fate.
- [x] 8.12 Both journeys name the page they back in `proves:`, and
  `journey validate` passes — every gesture states its `expect`.

## 9. Documentation

- [x] 9.1 `docs/architecture/invariants.md`: an automatic name never overwriting a chosen one, and the
  checkout's HEAD as the truth about a task's branch, each tied to the test
  that proves it.
- [x] 9.2 The `worktrees.branch` vocabulary in the manifest scaffold
  `manifest::ensure_exists` writes, spelled out and commented like
  `completion` already is — the knobs are discoverable by opening the file.
- [x] 9.3 The page the journeys name in `proves:`,
  `web/content/docs/workspace/agents.mdx`, says how the work gets a name
  (the agent names its branch as its first action, and that name is what
  the sidebar and the reviewer read), and `reference/project-files.mdx`
  carries the `branch` key it never documented. `journey validate` proves
  the link, never the prose.
- [x] 9.4 `docs/architecture/invariants.md` carries the moment as its own
  property, tied to the test that reads the region positionally. A rule
  with no mechanism behind it is one only a test and a line here keep.
