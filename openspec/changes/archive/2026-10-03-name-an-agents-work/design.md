## Context

See proposal.md — Why. Three constraints shape the approach, and all three
are already load-bearing elsewhere in the codebase:

- **The four harnesses agree on very little.** Only `PreToolUse` is claimed
  by all four (`hooks.rs`), and of those four only three claim the `deny`
  effect — OpenCode's hook route carries `observe`/`allow` alone. Any
  mechanism that must work everywhere cannot be a harness feature.
- **`TaskId` keys the checkout and the persisted state**, and `task.branch`
  is read by readiness, delivery, sync and the sidebar. Making the branch
  mutable is safe only because identity is not the name — a separation
  `task.rs` already states in its own module doc.
- **The projected `AGENTS.md` region is the one instruction surface every
  harness reads**, because it is a file in the repository rather than a
  vendor capability. It is also, per `project-agent-environment` §12, only
  as current as the last reconciliation.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- One name, authored once by the party that knows the work, reaching both
  the branch and the label.
- Enforcement where a harness can express it; an honest, recorded
  degradation where it cannot.
- A manual rename that is respected everywhere, by the same mechanism that
  makes it visible.

**Non-Goals:**
- Deriving a good name from text UZE happens to hold. The reconstructed
  prompt history exists and is best-effort by contract; a name derived from
  it reads like a sentence with hyphens, which is what this change exists
  to stop producing.
- A general agent-facing RPC. `uze agent` gains exactly the verbs a
  workflow step needs; a namespace is not an invitation to fill it.
- Naming a task before it exists. There is nothing to name at launch:
  UZE places a checkout, and only the agent's first turn carries the
  request that says what the work is. The moment is the agent's first
  action, which is the earliest moment there is — not launch.

## Decisions

### 1. The agent names the work, because only the agent knows it

The alternatives were measured rather than assumed.

*Derive from the user's prompt.* UZE already reconstructs submitted prompt
lines client-side (`PromptBuffer`) and stores them, harness-agnostically —
so this is genuinely available. Rejected on quality: a slug of a sentence
("resolver-a-questao-das-branchs-dos-agents") is the failure mode, not the
fix. It is also best-effort by contract — a chord, a history recall or a
paste marks the buffer untrusted and it is discarded — so it could not be
the only mechanism anyway.

*A harness hook that returns metadata.* The portable Hook ABI has no output
channel at all ("its stdout carries nothing"), and no prompt event exists in
the vocabulary. This would need a new event and a new data channel, and
would then work only where all four harnesses have both.

*A Skill instructing the agent.* ADR-030 is explicit that `invoke:` answers
who **may** invoke, never that anything **will**; on Antigravity neither
switch exists at all. A Skill is a suggestion gated on discovery.

**Chosen: a command the agent runs, instructed by the projected region.**
The command is the mechanism and the projected text is how the agent learns
it; §2 is when it is asked for, and §6 is what became of the hook that was
going to make it non-optional.

### 2. The moment is the first action, not the first commit

A surface nothing calls names nothing, so the moment matters as much as the
command. The first commit was the obvious moment and the wrong one: by then
the agent is mid-task, the instruction competes with work already under
way, and a moment an agent reaches while busy is a moment it skips.

The first action is the moment where the cost is lowest and the
information is already there. A name states an *intention*, and the
intention is the one thing an agent holds before it has read anything — it
came with the request. Nothing it learns afterwards makes `fix/branch-naming`
easier to choose; what it learns afterwards is how to *do* the work, which
the subject deliberately does not describe.

Two consequences follow, and both are why this is a design decision rather
than a wording change. The clause is projected **first** — the region's
bullets are read in order, and an instruction placed after three rules
about commits and rebases reads as something to do later. And naming now
happens before the branch has a commit of its own, which is exactly the
state `name_task` is cheapest in: nothing to rename around, no readiness to
disturb, no published branch to freeze.

What it gives up is a name chosen with full knowledge of the change. That
is a trade already priced: the agent or the operator renames, and nothing
automatic overwrites the correction — while the automatic half (§6) stays as
the answer for work that reaches a commit having ignored all of this.

### 3. `uze agent` is an audience, not a category

ADR-019 gave the grammar one axis: root is project-scoped, `market`/`plugin`
are machine-scoped. `uze agent` adds a second axis — who reads the command —
and it does not blur the first, because everything under it is
project-scoped.

What it buys is a matching pair: commands whose audience is the agent are
hidden from `uze --help` and documented in the projected region. Each
audience reads one surface, and neither is polluted by the other's
vocabulary. `uze self-update` and `uze terminal` are the existing
precedent for a hidden command whose caller is not a person; this names the
pattern rather than inventing it.

Rejected: sorting the human help by frequency (treats a discovery symptom,
leaves the agent's commands in the person's list) and putting the verb at
the root (the most-typed command in the flow becomes indistinguishable from
the person's commands).

### 4. An automatic name never overwrites a chosen one

A name outside UZE's own namespace is never a candidate for an automatic
rename. The predicate is one question, `Agent::is_named`: is the branch
outside `agent/`? Putting a name outside the namespace is exactly what
naming does, so "outside the prefix" and "somebody chose this" are the
same fact.

The agent's own command is not an automatic step, and it renames whenever
it is asked: the work it holds turns out to be something else often
enough that naming it once was never the realistic case. It was first
built to refuse a second name, and what that refusal stranded in practice
was a branch UZE had derived from a commit, which nothing downstream could
tell from one an agent had chosen.

Two consequences, both simplifications: there is no precedence ladder
(the derivation asks the predicate and stops), and adopting a manual
rename automatically protects it, because the adopted branch is no longer
in the namespace. Reflecting a rename and refusing to overwrite it stop
being two mechanisms. A published branch keeps its remote name through
`published_as`, whatever happens to the local one.

### 5. The vocabulary is closed, and the project closes it

A proposed name must be validated, and only a closed set is validatable —
which is the whole point, since the name comes from a model. `conventional`
is the market's most adopted vocabulary (Conventional Commits: spec'd,
tooled, and already what every branch and commit in this repository uses),
`gitflow` the runner-up, `flat` for GitHub Flow, `agent` for today.

A project may also declare its own list instead of a preset, because a
preset that almost fits invites misuse: `style` in Conventional Commits
means formatting, not visual design, and a team wanting `ui` should declare
`ui` rather than mislabel work as `style`. Presets are named lists; the
validation is identical either way.

### 6. The automatic half is a Git fact, not a harness feature

The design carried a `PreToolUse` `deny` here, and building it produced
three findings that removed it — kept in the record because the reasoning
is the useful part:

*It could not cover the four.* OpenCode claims `observe`/`allow` only, and
`assess` routes an unpreservable `deny` as `Unsupported` rather than
degrading it. So the mechanism chosen to answer "it has to work always"
was the one part of the design that could not.

*It cost a trust decision.* A Hook is an executable capability, and the
default plugin is bootstrapped onto every machine with `NoTrustAuthority`
— the bootstrap refuses the package outright (`TRUST_REQUIRED`). Shipping
it as a second plugin made enforcement an install and a prompt, for a
guarantee that held on three harnesses out of four.

*Its handler depended on `uze`.* ADR-040 took the binary off the hook
execution path deliberately, and the handler put it back — a plugin whose
bytes only work where UZE is installed is not a portable package.

**Chosen instead: derive at the first commit, on the evaluation pass that
already runs.** It is a Git fact, so it holds on every harness and on the
next one; it needs no plugin, no trust and no ABI; and it covers every
completion behaviour, where the publish-time fallback only ever covered
`pr` — which was the actual hole. The model still authors the name: it
wrote the commit message.

What it gives up is deliberateness — `feat/answer-ping-with-pong` instead
of the two words an agent would have chosen — which is exactly why the
projected clause says so, and why `uze agent work name` arriving first
wins.

### 7. The publish-time fallback stays, demoted

`readable_branch_name` exists and is the right shape; what was wrong was its
input (a label that is always the identifier). Re-sourced from the first
commit's subject, it becomes the answer for a task nobody named — including
every task on a harness that cannot deny. The guarantee it backs is narrow
and worth stating: no pull request ever carries a generated identifier.

## Candidate ADRs

- **An agent-audience command namespace** — `uze agent` establishes that a
  command's audience decides its surface (hidden from human help,
  documented in the projected region), which refines ADR-019's grammar and
  is expensive to move once agents are instructed to call into it.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- **[A model proposes a bad name that passes validation]** → Mitigation: the
  agent or the operator renames, and no automatic step overwrites the
  correction. Validation constrains the shape, not the judgment.
- **[Renaming a branch under a running agent]** → Mitigation: the rename
  happens on the agent's own explicit call, from its own checkout; Git
  renames the branch HEAD follows, so its next `git` command is unaffected.
  The projected text tells it to ask Git rather than remember the name.
- **[The projected instruction is stale, so the agent reads the wrong
  vocabulary]** → Mitigation: this is `project-agent-environment` §12, and
  the dependency is why that change lands first.
- **[`agent/` stops being how UZE's branches are found]** → Mitigation:
  `prune_integrated_branches` scans the prefix today; it must also consider
  the branches the task store names, or a renamed branch is never collected.
