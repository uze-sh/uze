# Environment overrides:
#   UZE_VERSION   Pin a release (e.g. 1.0.0-beta.1); default: latest.
#   UZE_BASE_URL  Alternate download root (mirror or local test fixture).
#   UZE_BIN_DIR   Installation directory (default: $XDG_BIN_HOME or
#                 $HOME/.local/bin).
#   NO_COLOR      Any value forces the plain, escape-free transcript.
