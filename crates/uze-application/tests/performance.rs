//! Budget tests for every command `src/command_performance.rs` classifies
//! `Budgeted`, and for the one read the management screens are made of.
//!
//! Its own test target, and that is the whole point: a budget is a claim
//! about a path, and a wall clock inside the crate's lib-test binary
//! measures the path *plus* the 186 sibling tests sharing its thread pool,
//! several of which spawn Git. That reads as a regression on a loaded
//! machine and passes on an idle one. Cargo runs test targets one after
//! another, so a target holding nothing but these measures what it claims
//! to.
//!
//! What each test asserts is exact and the same everywhere: a warm path
//! takes no live harness probe and no reach for the Git binary. The clock
//! is a backstop beside those — see `BUDGET`.
//!
//! Each test times a command's warm path — a fresh `UzeApplication`, the
//! way a new invocation is — against a world where anything expensive is
//! visible: the one harness sleeps half a second per detection probe, and
//! the registered marketplace's repository is deleted once the world is
//! built, so a listing that clones cannot answer at all. The ceiling is
//! the best of three runs: it states what the path *can* do, which is
//! what a regression changes, without failing on a scheduler hiccup.
