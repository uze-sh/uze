//! Cache of what a registered marketplace offers — ADR 018's contract
//! applied to a remote.
//!
//! A marketplace registered by URL is a Git repository somewhere else.
//! Listing what it offers means reading its `marketplace.json`, and doing
//! that by cloning the whole repository into a scratch directory made
//! every listing a network round trip: seconds over SSH, paid by
//! `market list`, by the plugin picker, and twice by every refresh of the
//! management screen. A remote is the one input UZE reads that has no
//! fingerprint at all, so the contract here is TTL plus mutation
//! invalidation, nothing cleverer:
//!
//! - one checkout per Git marketplace under
//!   `UzeHome::marketplace_cache_dir()`, with a small `catalogue.json`
//!   beside it recording the source it was read from and when;
//! - in-process memoization on top, so a marketplace listing and a plugin
//!   listing in one command read the directory once;
//! - a bounded TTL, after which the next read clones again — once per
//!   window, not once per screen;
//! - `market add` fills the entry from the clone it already made to learn
//!   the marketplace's name, so registering the same source again is how
//!   a catalogue is refreshed on demand; `market remove` drops it;
//! - a local marketplace is read in place every time: there is no remote
//!   to spare, and its author is editing it.
//!
//! Fail-open like the other two caches: an unreadable entry is a miss,
//! and a refill that fails while an expired entry still exists answers
//! with what was last seen — a listing must not be worse offline than it
//! was the last time the remote answered.
