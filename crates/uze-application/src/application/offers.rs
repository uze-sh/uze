//! What can be done to a thing, decided once.
//!
//! A screen that acts on rows needs its surfaces to agree about the same
//! question: the buttons in its detail view, the index of everything, and
//! the keyboard. They agree because they read one list — this one — rather
//! than each re-deriving it from the same fields and drifting.
//!
//! It also settles where the decision lives. Whether a plugin can be
//! updated is a fact about the plugin, not a rendering concern, and a
//! presentation layer that filtered on `installed && update_available`
//! itself was one refactor away from disagreeing with the CLI about it.
//!
//! An offer that is *not* available carries why, for a surface with room to
//! say it; the detail view draws only what can be done now.
