//! The authoring orchestration: scaffold → register → link, scaffold →
//! manifest entry, and the offline check, each one deterministic answer.
//!
//! Every verb here is machine-scoped by construction (ADR-019): the
//! marketplace record lives in the machine's own registry, the bytes stay
//! in the directory the author named, and no project file is touched. A
//! scaffolded marketplace is born registered **and linked** to the
//! directory it was scaffolded in, so installs read the author's working
//! tree — including not-yet-committed files — from the first moment.
