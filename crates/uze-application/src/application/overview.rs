//! Overview workspace summary — the smallest semantic read model that
//! answers "what kind of UZE workspace am I in, and is it ready to work",
//! composed entirely from existing core/application primitives:
//!
//! - workspace detection (`uze_core::anchor`) for root + kind
//! - `agents.lock` parsing (`uze_core::project_lock`) for the consumer side
//! - `marketplace.json` parsing (`acquisition::marketplace`) for the marketplace side
//! - Store package ids (`installed_packages`) for installed vs required
//! - `Context::inspect` for the memory/portability half
//!
//! This is deliberately a *projection*: files (agents.lock, marketplace.json,
//! `.agents/`, paths, counts-by-inspection) are evidence used *here* to
//! compute states, but the states are the product. The TUI renders these
//! enums verbatim; it never re-derives a `Ready` from lock bytes.
//!
//! No Store writes, no acquisition, no network, no vendor CLI: every
//! field is computable from the cwd + the current Store index in
//! milliseconds (full per-receipt vendor inspection stays on the Doctor
//! report, where it is served by the inspection cache — see ADR 018).
