//! Capability-scoped views onto [`UzeApplication`].
//!
//! One handle that can do everything is the shape that makes "I want to add
//! one feature and I have to touch the middle" true: every operation lands
//! on the same `impl`, and the type says nothing about what a caller is
//! allowed to reach. It also makes scoping inexpressible — "this caller may
//! read packages but must never write the Store" has no way to be said when
//! the only handle there is can do both.
//!
//! Each service here is a borrowed view: no state of its own, no cost, and
//! the state stays owned in one place. What changes is that a caller now
//! names the capability it wants, and gets only that.
//!
//! Service boundaries follow the module the operations already lived in —
//! those files were drawn deliberately, and redrawing them in the same
//! change would have made the diff argue two things at once.
