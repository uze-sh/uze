//! The colour vocabulary.
//!
//! A token names what the coloured thing *is*, never what it looks like.
//! That distinction is the whole point: `state.in-flight` can be cyan in one
//! theme and orange in another and still be right, whereas a token called
//! `cyan` is a lie the moment someone themes it. Two of today's colours
//! exist only because the state hues were already spoken for — an in-flight
//! delivery is not a warning, and delivered work is not a badge — and they
//! arrive here under the meanings they were always serving.
