//! The glyph vocabulary — an icon set, referenced by name.
//!
//! Every mark UZE draws as chrome is named here and resolved from the active
//! theme, for the same reason colours are: a glyph written inline is a glyph
//! nobody can change. A theme replaces any of them, which is what makes a
//! pure-ASCII UZE possible on a terminal with no Unicode font.
//!
//! A symbol carries its display width alongside its glyph. Today the widths
//! are implicit in the literals — several call sites lay a column out from
//! the length of the string they typed — so swapping a glyph for a wider one
//! would quietly shear every row that contains it. Resolving the width with
//! the glyph is what makes a replacement safe, and letting a theme override
//! it is the only thing that can be right for a font whose private-use
//! glyphs lie about their own width.
