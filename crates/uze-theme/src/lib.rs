//! UZE's design vocabulary — the one place that says what a colour or a
//! glyph *means*, and the schema anyone can write to change what it looks
//! like.
//!
//! Every surface UZE draws — the workspace client, the management TUI, the
//! CLI's own output, the colours a pane reports to the program inside it —
//! selects appearance by naming a [`Token`] or a [`Symbol`] and resolving it
//! against the active [`Theme`]. Nothing outside this crate holds a colour
//! value, which is what keeps those surfaces from drifting apart the way
//! four hand-maintained copies of one palette always do.
//!
//! What belongs here: the vocabulary ([`Token`], [`Symbol`]), the file
//! format ([`ThemeFile`]), and the resolver that turns a partial theme file
//! into a complete [`Theme`]. What does not: anything that knows the machine
//! (this crate resolves no path and reads no environment — a caller hands it
//! a file), anything that knows UZE's domain, and anything that knows how to
//! draw. A rendering library's colour type is the caller's business; this
//! crate speaks [`Rgb`].
//!
//! ```
//! use uze_theme::{Token, active};
//!
//! // Works before any theme is loaded — the built-in default needs no I/O.
//! let accent = active().color(Token::Accent);
//! assert_eq!((accent.0, accent.1, accent.2), (255, 255, 255));
//! ```
