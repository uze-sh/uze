//! The theme every surface draws against, right now.
//!
//! A theme is process-wide and cannot change in the middle of a frame, so it
//! lives here rather than as a parameter threaded through several hundred
//! call sites that could never legitimately disagree about it. The lock is
//! what lets a running TUI switch themes without restarting: the write
//! happens once, between frames, and every read on the draw path is
//! uncontended.
//!
//! There is no initialisation step. Before anything is loaded — in a test, in
//! a CLI invocation that never reads a theme file, in code that runs before
//! `$UZE_HOME` is resolved — [`active`] answers with the built-in default,
//! which needs no I/O.
