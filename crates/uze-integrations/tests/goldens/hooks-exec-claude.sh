# hooks/exec — generated from hooks.json, one per harness. The harness runs
# this; it runs the author's handlers. The handlers never see a harness
# payload and never write harness JSON: the context arrives as HOOK_*
# environment and the decision leaves as an exit code: 0 allows, while
# 3 denies and the reason is read from stderr. Anything else
# is a failure that follows the group's effect. Only the first 4096
# bytes of a handler's stderr become the reason a harness is handed.

#              everything it started are stopped, and the group's effect
#              decides, exactly as for any other handler failure
