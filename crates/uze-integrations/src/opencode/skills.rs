//! OpenCode Agent Skill exposure — invocation-policy-aware delivery through
//! OpenCode's native Skill mechanism.
//!
//! OpenCode discovers Skills natively at `~/.agents/skills` (the shared
//! root it shares with Codex), and its SKILL.md frontmatter natively
//! expresses both halves of the canonical invocation policy:
//!
//! - `metadata.opencode/autoinvoke: false` omits the skill from
//!   model-facing discovery while it stays registered and explicitly
//!   activatable by ID (model=false preserved — documented, and this
//!   wrapper's exact syntax is the documented `metadata: { opencode/autoinvoke: <bool> }`
//!   shape);
//! - `slash: false` hides the skill from the `/` command catalog — which
//!   is *not* the whole of user invocation on V2, see below.
//!
//! A canonical user-only Skill is projected as an OpenCode **Skill**,
//! never as a vendor Command — the vendor Command primitive remains a
//! projection detail UZE does not need for this harness (ADR-030 §9).
//!
//! # `invoke.user: false` degrades, and says so (measured 2026-09-06)
//!
//! V2 has two explicit-invocation paths, and `slash` gates one of them.
//! A Skill is `/id` when `slash === true`, and `@id` — a mention —
//! always: the picker renders every discovered Skill as `"@" + id`, and
//! `SessionPrompt.prepare` expands a mentioned Skill's body into the user
//! message whatever its `slash` value. So `slash: false` removes a Skill
//! from the `/` catalog and leaves it invocable by mention.
//!
//! This was `Native` here until the Lab learned to *invoke* rather than to
//! read a catalog: `skill-model-only-is-not-invocable` types `@flow:analyze`
//! and finds its body in the request. The claim was never wrong on purpose
//! — nothing measured it. It is now Adaptable, with the degradation
//! stated, and the Lab holds it there.
//!
//! UZE materializes every Skill as one wrapper SKILL.md under `$UZE_HOME` —
//! loading the canonical name/description/body, never rewriting the Store
//! — and symlinks the shared root entry at it. OpenCode uses `name` as the
//! visible label, so direct Store links would lose the stable qualified
//! label whenever the canonical skill has a bare name. Because Codex reads the
//! SAME physical entry from `~/.agents/skills`, the wrapper is the superset
//! representation (`crate::shared::skill::write_superset_skill_wrapper`):
//! OpenCode's own controls AND Codex's `agents/openai.yaml` policy sidecar
//! for `model=false`, so the entry is correct whichever integration
//! created it (ADR-030 §25).
