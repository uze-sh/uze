//! The one path-safety predicate proven identical across every native
//! package integration that parses a manifest-declared path: reject
//! anything absolute, `..`-escaping, empty, or a bare `.` — never coerce
//! it into something safe. Extracted after fixing a real divergence this
//! predicate itself is the fix for (see this function's own history):
//! Claude's per-entry normalization used to strip a leading `/` before
//! testing `Path::is_absolute()`, so `/etc/passwd` silently became the
//! relative declaration `etc/passwd` instead of being rejected — Codex's
//! independently-written equivalent never did this and was already
//! correct. Once Claude's copy was fixed to match, the two were no longer
//! an ACCIDENTAL_SIMILARITY (the Integration Capability Contracts Audit's
//! classification at the time) but a REAL_SHARED_CONTRACT, so this module
//! is that contract's one home.
//!
//! Beside it live the other path facts every integration states the same
//! way: where a harness's generated artifacts are staged, and the removal
//! of a wrapper nothing references any more.
//!
//! Deliberately narrow: the validation predicate is a predicate only, not
//! a universal path parser. What counts as a declared path field at all
//! (`skills: [...]` vs `skills: "..."`, one array entry vs one whole
//! directory, an inline object vs an external file reference) stays
//! entirely vendor-specific — Claude's and Codex's own manifest schemas
//! differ in that shape, and this function has no opinion on it. Both
//! Antigravity's and Claude's/Codex's coverage functions that read a
//! structural surface rather than a declared path never call this module.
