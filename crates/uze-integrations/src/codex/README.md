# Codex Integration

Peer integration for OpenAI Codex CLI. Transparent attachment: Agent Skills
as a directory of their own in Codex's documented user root
(`~/.agents/skills/<label>`), MCP via
`codex mcp add` (global only — no `--scope` flag exists), and a native
plugin path — either the package's own explicit `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
via a UZE-generated local marketplace catalogue
(`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` under
`$UZE_HOME/runtime/attachments/codex/explicit/`, beside a real-file mirror of
each such package, referenced by
`codex plugin marketplace add`), or, absent one, a UZE-synthesized envelope
in a second, UZE-owned marketplace (Generated Native Package, ADR-013).

## Support

| Surface | Status | Delivery | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Native Package (explicit) | Supported, exact coverage | `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` → generated catalogue → `codex plugin add` | CODE_FACT + TESTED (11 tests) + EMPIRICAL (config/install only) |
| Native Package (generated) | Supported, exact coverage | Second `uze-store` catalogue (own root, path-containment-safe) → `codex plugin add` (ADR-013) | CODE_FACT + TESTED (15 tests) + EMPIRICAL — real-binary dogfood (Codex 0.148.0): attach → inspect (Matched) → detach (Missing) → reinstall (Matched) |
| Skills | Supported | A directory in `~/.agents/skills/<label>`: rendered SKILL.md, the policy sidecar when it applies, supporting files copied (Codex does not list a linked `SKILL.md`) | EMPIRICAL (behavioral, ADR-006; Lab `experiments/codex/study_mechanics`) |
| Skill invocation policy | Supported (model=false) / Degraded (user=false) | Generated wrapper + `agents/openai.yaml` → `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false`; no way to hide a skill from explicit `$skill` invocation — stated honestly (ADR-030) | DOCUMENTED (Codex Build skills docs) + EMPIRICAL (verified against codex-cli 0.149.0 via `codex debug prompt-input`) |
| MCP | Supported (config), unproven behaviorally | `codex mcp add` → `~/.codex/config.toml` | EMPIRICAL (configuration), UNKNOWN (discovery), gap (behavioral) |
| Context (AGENTS.md) | Native, out of this crate's scope | Codex reads `AGENTS.md` directly | DOCUMENTED |
| Project `.agents/skills` | Native | Codex reads the project's `./.agents/skills` itself; UZE writes nothing into the repository | EMPIRICAL (codex-cli 0.158, Lab contract `context-project-skill-reaches-model`) |
| Project `.agents/agents` (runtime) | Supported | Codex does not read `./.agents/agents` (its project root is `.codex/agents`, trusted projects only). The launcher adds `-c agents={"<name>" = { description, config_file }, ...}`, a configuration layer Codex merges over the user's own, naming each agent by its logical name (frontmatter `name`, else the file stem; no plugin prefix). Each `config_file` is a role file under the runtime projection, outside the repository, holding `developer_instructions` and the fields `harness.codex` gives it; a role file naming `name` or `description` is refused by Codex. `CODEX_HOME` would reach the same roots only by replacing the user's configuration (RUNTIME_PROJECTION) | EMPIRICAL (codex-cli 0.158: Lab contract `context-project-agent-reaches-model`; `experiments/codex/project-agents`, an interactive session on an app-server daemon started without the flag, the user's own agents still offered) + TESTED (`codex::runtime::tests`) |
| Agents | Supported | Generated `~/.codex/agents/<label>.toml` with `name = "<label>"`, `description`, `developer_instructions`; any other field is dropped (Codex refuses the whole file over an unknown key or a `tools` list) and reported as Degraded | EMPIRICAL (codex-cli 0.158, Lab probe) |
| Hooks | Supported | Native — one merged entry per canonical group in `~/.codex/hooks.json`, one quoted shell line invoking the generated `hooks/exec` wrapper (ADR-033, ADR-040). The shell alias is `exec_command` with a `cmd` argument. Requires the `[features].hooks` flag in `~/.codex/config.toml`. | EMPIRICAL — the conformance vertical's `hooks` suite |
| Runtime Integration | Project agents only | `runtime_contribution` adds the `-c agents=...` layer above when the project has `.agents/agents`, passthrough otherwise | CODE_FACT |

    milestone's dogfood caught before it shipped — see ADR-013.)
```

Without either kind of envelope, Skills and MCP decompose individually
through the same Skill directory / `codex mcp add` mechanisms described above.

## Native package

`package_exposure_plan` checks whether `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` exists,
then computes a real intersection via `codex_exact_coverage`
(`codex/plugin.rs`): the manifest's `skills` field names one directory whose
entire subtree is covered (component-wise `Path::starts_with`, not a string
prefix — `skills-extra` is never mistaken for inside `skills`), and its
`mcpServers` field names one external file (typically `.mcp.json`, distinct
from the portable root-level `mcp.json`) holding the standard
`{"mcpServers": {...}}` shape — a server is covered iff its name appears
there. Either field can independently be absent, empty, malformed, escape the
package root (`..`, an absolute path), or point at a file that can't be
read/parsed — each case degrades to "no coverage for that field" rather than
erroring; the package still installs natively, just with a smaller (possibly
empty) `provided_resource_identities`. Undeclared resources fall through to
individual attachment (Skill directory / `codex mcp add`), never silently
dropped. `attach_package` then ensures the derived catalogue is registered as
a Codex marketplace and runs `codex plugin add <id>@uze-local`, idempotent
via a pre-check against `codex plugin list --json`.

**Generated Native Package** (`codex/generate.rs`, ADR-013): mirrors
Claude's `claude/generate.rs` structurally, adapted to Codex's own manifest
shape — `skills` as a single directory string (not an inline list),
`mcpServers` as an external-file reference rather than embedding servers
inline. `generatable()`/`generated_exact_coverage()` use the same
capability-based eligibility rule as Claude's (a single Skill or MCP server
alone qualifies); an explicit envelope, even malformed, always wins.

## Fallbacks

- **Skills and MCP**: no pre-setup fallback exists (`Unsupported`, with a
  rationale naming `uze setup`, until it completes) — ADR-006, ADR-007.

## Runtime

None. `runtime_contribution`/`supports_runtime_integration` are not
overridden — Codex gets the shim/dispatch machinery for free (ADR-014) but
does nothing with it, and nothing here anticipates that it should.

## Lifecycle

| Artifact | Receipt kind | Inspect | Detach |
|---|---|---|---|
| Skill directory | `GeneratedTree` (standard) | `tree_sha256` against the receipt | Standard, only when it still matches |
| MCP entry | `VendorConfigEntry` | `codex mcp get --json`; absence = exit 1 + stable stderr string, any other non-zero stays `Blocked` | `codex mcp remove` |
| Native plugin (explicit) | `IntegrationOwned{kind:"marketplace-plugin"}` | `codex plugin marketplace list --json` + `codex plugin list --json`, checked before every destructive call (ADR-009) | `codex plugin remove` |
| Native plugin (generated) | `IntegrationOwned{kind:"marketplace-plugin-generated"}` | Same `inspect_codex_plugin` (marketplace-root-agnostic) | Same `CodexMarketplace::remove_plugin`, plus `shared::marketplace::remove_generated_package` (Derived Artifact) |

MCP inspection is fully structured (`--json`), unlike Claude's raw-file read
— a genuine advantage of Codex's CLI surface.

## Limitations

- **`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`'s `skills`/`mcpServers` fields are singular
  strings, not arrays** — one shared skills directory, one shared MCP
  manifest file — so partial declaration is coarser-grained than Claude's
  per-entry arrays: Codex can't declare "these two of three skills" without
  moving the undeclared one physically outside the shared directory. Within
  that shape, coverage is exact (`codex_exact_coverage`, 11 tests).
- `codex plugin marketplace add`/`codex plugin add` failures surface as a
  single `ExposureUnavailable` string; no structured retry/diagnosis.
- No override of `exposure_name_candidates` (uses the fully-qualified-only
  trait default), unlike Claude/OpenCode which both try the bare name first
  for Skills. Not confirmed whether this is deliberate.
- Codex caps how much of a project doc it reads (`project_doc_max_bytes`,
  32 KiB when the vendor docs were last read for this, 2026-08-21) and skips
  empty files. A contributed `AGENTS.md` region past that cap is truncated by
  Codex, silently: UZE neither measures nor reports it, so the same project
  context can be shorter here than on every other harness.

## Evidence

- Tests: 28 (`codex::mcp::mcp_tests`: 1, `codex::plugin::plugin_tests`: 1,
  `codex::plugin::codex_native_coverage_tests`: 11 — full declaration,
  subset, Store-extra-skill, Store-extra-MCP, manifest-references-missing
  file, malformed MCP file, unexpected field shape, `..` escape, absolute
  path, empty declaration, partial-coverage-plus-fallback coexistence —
  `codex::generate::generated_native_tests`: 15, mirroring Claude's
  generated-native matrix), all passing.
  `tests/plugin_first_vertical_slice.rs`/`tests/north_star_flow_fixture.rs`
  re-confirmed green under the generated route.
- Real harness version empirically validated live this milestone: Codex CLI
  **0.148.0**, isolated `HOME`/`UZE_HOME`, no credentials. A full generated
  -native lifecycle (attach → inspect Matched → detach Missing → reinstall
  Matched) was run against the real binary and caught a genuine receipt
  defect (`package_root` recorded as the Store path instead of the
  installed generated directory — see ADR-013) before it shipped; the
  explicit-native path's install/attach was separately confirmed live via
  `tests/shared_agent_skill_root_naming.rs`'s original (now-faked-for-CI)
  real-binary run.

  `web/content/docs/concepts/delivery.mdx` for the capability map.

## Next

1. Close Codex MCP behavioral verification (blocked today by
   `codex exec`'s approval gate in non-interactive mode — ADR-007).
2. Confirm or drop the fully-qualified-only `exposure_name_candidates`
   choice deliberately, with a doc comment either way.
