# Antigravity CLI Integration

**Status: primary Google-family v0 harness** (validated against `agy`
**1.1.21** in an isolated `$HOME`). Full audit/evidence:
`docs/architecture/antigravity-compatibility.md`; decision: ADR-027.

| Surface | Status | Mechanism | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Plugin (explicit) | SUPPORTED, exact coverage | Superseded: every package is installed from a plugin UZE generates (`$UZE_HOME/runtime/attachments/antigravity/generated/<id>/`), because agy staged a Store tree with `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` unresolved and its agents under bare names; an earlier Store-tree receipt is retired | PROVEN — real-binary dogfood: attach → `agy plugin list` shows import → inspect MATCHED → remove → unregistered → reinstall MATCHED |
| Plugin (generated) | SUPPORTED, exact coverage | canonical `mcp.json` → generated envelope (`mcp_config.json` translation: `url`/`httpUrl` → `serverUrl`) installed from `$UZE_HOME/runtime/attachments/antigravity/plugins/<id>/` | PROVEN — real-binary dogfood + `agy plugin validate` (skills + mcpServers processed) |
| Skills | SUPPORTED, native (default policy) | via plugin (package-level) or a managed directory `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills/<label>` (CLI-documented global skills root, which agy 1.2 moves to `~/.gemini/config/skills` and links back): SKILL.md and the supporting files, copied; receipt `GeneratedTree` | DOCUMENTED (root) + TESTED (lifecycle/drift) |
| Skill invocation policy | NATIVE, both halves | `disable-slash-command: true` preserves `model=true,user=false`; `disable-model-invocation: true` (since 1.1.27) preserves `model=false,user=true` | PROVEN (`contract/skill.py::_assert_invocation`) + TESTED |
| MCP | SUPPORTED, adapted | `agy mcp add <name> <command> [args…]` → `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json` | PROVEN (add/list/remove/disable) + TESTED (inspection) |

## Delivery

```
Store canonical package (plugin.json + skills/ [+ mcp.json])
        │
        ├─ no canonical MCP surface ──▶ agy plugin install <Store path>   [Explicit]
        │                                → staged byte copy at
        │                                  ~/.gemini/config/plugins/<name>/
        │                                → import_manifest.json registration
        │                                → 1 receipt (content fingerprint)
        └─ canonical MCP surface ──────▶ generated envelope (mcp_config.json
                                          translation) → agy plugin install   [Generated]
```

The staged tree is a **Derived Artifact** (ADR-013 §5): the Store stays the
single source of truth, the staged copy is rebuilt from the Store on
attach, its content fingerprint is the ownership proof, and it is removed
through the official `agy plugin uninstall` verb. There is no link verb in
Antigravity (symlinks are dereferenced — verified 1.1.19), so the vendor
always stages bytes; UZE never *reads* from the staged copy and never lets
it become authoritative.

## Decisions worth stating

- **`plugin install` copies, and UZE accepted that.** The alternative —
  hand-writing `import_manifest.json` and placing the plugin under
  `config/plugins/` ourselves — would reimplement a vendor private format.
  The cost is a byte copy; the mitigation is the derived-artifact
  discipline plus the fingerprint receipt. A same-named foreign import is
  refused (install merges, so overwriting would clobber user state).
- **`mcp.json` is not read by the plugin system** — the vendor file is
  `mcp_config.json`, so MCP-bearing canonical packages take the generated
  route; the translation `url`/`httpUrl` → `serverUrl` is the vendor's own
  documented legacy-migration rule.
- **Invocation policy is carried by the vendor's own controls**:
  `disable-slash-command: true` keeps a model-only Skill out of `/`, and
  `disable-model-invocation: true` (since 1.1.27) keeps a user-only Skill
  from the model. Any package containing a non-default Skill is
  decomposed so an unchanged plugin tree cannot bypass the per-skill
  policy wrapper or duplicate it.
- **Context is Native**: `AGENTS.md` and `GEMINI.md` are both parsed
  (official docs: "identical workspace context rules"), so UZE
  generates no bridge file.
- **No runtime shim**; internal invocations always resolve the real `agy`
  outside `$UZE_HOME/shims`.

- **Agents are a generated Markdown file** in the global agents directory,
  named with the label and carrying `name: <label>` and `description`:
  Antigravity 1.2.x reads the name from the frontmatter, lists no agent
  without one, scans no subdirectory, and silently drops an agent with a
  Claude-style `model` or string `tools`, so nothing else is carried and
  the loss is reported as Degraded. The delivery itself is Degraded too:
  1.2.17 offers `invoke_subagent` only to an agent whose own definition
  lists it, so the agent a person starts on cannot dispatch a delivered
  one (Lab `agent-*-exposed`, a registered declaration).

## Delivery notes

  **Hooks are delivered into the shared `~/.gemini/config/hooks.json`**
  (ADR-033/ADR-040), not into the generated plugin: one named entry per
  canonical group, keyed `<package>:<group-id>`, grouped with the translated
  matcher for the tool events and flat for `Stop`, whose command is the
  generated `hooks/exec` wrapper under
  `$UZE_HOME/runtime/attachments/antigravity/hooks/exec` — absolute, because
  the harness runs a hook with its cwd set to the directory holding
  `hooks.json`, and no `uze` sits on the execution path. The document root
  *is* the named-hook map, so UZE owns exactly its own keys: a hand-written
  hook in the same file is never read, rewritten or removed, and drift or an
  unreadable file blocks the mutation. This is the same shape as Codex's
  shared `hooks.json` delivery.

  It is delivered there because **the harness does not read a plugin's
  `hooks.json`.** The vendor's own plugin guide says hooks in
  `plugins/<name>/hooks.json` are "registered and run during the agent's
  lifecycle"; on 1.1.24 they are not. `agy plugin validate` counts them, the
  plugin is listed with a `hooks` component and enabled in `config.json`,
  and the session still reports `loaded 0 named hooks from 0 hooks.json
  file(s)` — it never opens the file. The Conformance Lab measures that live
  every run (`hooks > delivery`), so if a later build starts reading plugin
  hooks, the check says so and the delivery can move back.

  One vendor gate stands in front of every delivered hook: the executor
  reads `enable_json_hooks` (field 17 of the backend's
  `CustomizationConfig`, switched server-side by the `json-hooks-enabled`
  feature flag). Through 1.1.24 that config reached the CLI only over the
  CloudCode backend it speaks when signed in to a Google account, so a
  `GEMINI_API_KEY` session loaded the same hooks, listed them under
  `/hooks`, and ran none of them — vendor bug
  [google-antigravity/antigravity-cli#893](https://github.com/google-antigravity/antigravity-cli/issues/893)
  ("hooks loaded but never executed when authenticated via GEMINI_API_KEY"),
  alongside #78 recording that the Gemini API-key path is unsupported at
  all. On 1.1.25 the Lab measured the same hook firing under the API key.
  The vertical runs signed in and asserts UZE's own hooks there (deny
  relayed, tool blocked, first-deny-wins, allow executes), and asserts the
  vendor-format control hook on the API-key mode as well, so a return of
  #893 is a red check, not a silent mode dependency.
- A project's `.agents/` is read by agy itself, per workspace, with no UZE
  involvement (`AntigravityIntegration::project_resource_route`).
  Measured on 1.2.12: `.agents/skills` by the Lab contract
  `context-project-skill-reaches-model`, and `.agents/agents`,
  `.agents/mcp_config.json` and `.agents/hooks.json` by the discovery study
  of 2026-09-28 (read off the requests the harness sent; `agy mcp list` shows
  only the global servers, so it is not the place to look). The project
  authors that directory, and UZE writes nothing into it.
