//! Harness-agnostic UZE domain, persistence, planning, and integration
//! contracts. Concrete vendor integrations and presentation layers depend on
//! this crate; it never depends on them.
//!
//! # How to read this crate
//!
//! Five concerns, each with its own module documenting what belongs in it.
//! Read the concern before the module: the answer to "what kind of thing is
//! `hook`?" is that it sits under [`capability`], which is a different
//! question from where its file happens to be.
//!
//! | concern | what it owns |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`package`] | where a package's bytes come from, and where they live |
//! | [`capability`] | what a plugin declares, portably |
//! | [`delivery`] | how a capability reaches a harness |
//! | [`project`] | what a project declares, and what UZE writes into it |
//! | [`machine`] | the local environment outside UZE's own state |
//!
//! The public paths below are flat and unchanged — `uze_core::store`, not
//! `uze_core::package::store`. The grouping says how the crate reads from
//! the inside; renaming 581 call sites across the workspace would have
//! bought nothing but a diff nobody can review. Removing a re-export later
//! lets the compiler drive that migration one module at a time, if it ever
//! earns its keep.

/// Per-workspace prompt log for agent tabs. Borderline: only the TUI reads
/// it, which argued for evicting it — but it is UZE-owned state under
/// `UzeHome`, like [`profile_state`], and the crate that would host it
/// (`uze-terminal`) depends on nothing here today, which is a property
/// worth more than this module's tidiness. Left at the root, named, rather
/// than filed under a concern it does not belong to.

/// What the TUI keeps of its own shape between runs. Here for the same
/// reason [`prompt_history`] is: UZE-owned state under `UzeHome`, read by
/// the one client that draws it.

/// The operator's `config.toml`. Knows files and sections, never what a
/// setting means: each section is owned by the module named after it.
/// Root-level for the same reason [`profile_state`] is: UZE-owned state
/// under `UzeHome` that belongs to no portable concern.

/// `[appearance]`: which theme and glyph set are chosen, and which theme

// Flat public API. Each line also says which concern the module belongs to,
// which is the second reason for keeping them: the crate root is where a
// reader looks first.
