//! Core small, local-only durability primitives for UZE-owned state.
//!
//! They intentionally do not attempt distributed transactions with vendor
//! CLIs. A confirmed external side effect is recorded immediately by the
//! caller, while these helpers keep registry and ledger replacement atomic.
//!
//! # What UZE keeps, and what losing it costs
//!
//! Everything UZE persists belongs to exactly one tier, and the tier is
//! decided by what deleting it costs — never by which module happened to
//! write it:
//!
//! - **bytes** (`store/`) — the installed packages.
//! - **record** (`state/`) — what UZE was told or decided: intent and
//!   ownership. Nothing else on the machine knows it, so removing it costs
//!   the operator. Only this tier declares a shape.
//! - **generated** (`runtime/`, `shims/`) — what UZE produced for another
//!   program to read. Removing it costs nothing; it is produced again.
//! - **remembered** (`cache/`) — what UZE observed and kept to go faster.
//!   Removing it costs nothing; it is observed again.
//!
//! A thing must not sit in a tier that claims a different cost than it has.
//! Generated content used to live at `state/attachments/`, one letter from
//! `attachments.json` — the ledger that says who owns what inside it — so
//! the directory read as authoritative while every byte in it was
//! reproducible. An operator deciding what was safe to delete had no way to
//! tell the two apart, and the answer is opposite for each.
//!
//! # Reading a record another build wrote
//!
//! That rule lives in [`crate::document`], because the terminal runtime
//! holds the workspace and depends on nothing of UZE's — and a durability
//! rule written in two places is the failure it exists to end. In short:
//! a shape this build knows is **carried across, silently**; setting a
//! record aside is the floor beneath that, not the policy; recovery has a
//! direction, so a record from a newer build is never taken; the shape is
//! read *before* the record; and a record with no shape at all is shape 1.
//!
//! A new document declares its tier by where [`crate::home::UzeHome`] puts
//! it, and — if it is a record — its shape and its ladder by implementing
//! [`crate::document::Shaped`]. Nothing else is needed, and nothing else is
//! allowed: every path UZE owns is named in the map, which
//! `every_path_uze_owns_is_named_in_the_map` fails the build over.
