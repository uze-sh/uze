//! The `[appearance]` section: which theme is active, which glyph set, and
//! where a user's own themes live — and whether the person was last seen
//! wanting light or dark, which is what an adaptive selection is decided by.
//!
//! Only the *selection* lives here. What a theme is — tokens, symbols, the
//! file format, how a partial one resolves — belongs to the design system,
//! which this crate knows nothing about: an id and a directory listing is
//! the whole of the domain's interest in appearance. That split is what
//! lets the vocabulary grow without the domain hearing about it.
//!
//! Machine-scoped, like Profiles: a project does not get to decide what the
//! operator's terminal looks like.
