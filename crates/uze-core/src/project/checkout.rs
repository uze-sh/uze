//! Isolated checkouts as slots.
//!
//! A slot is a long-lived working tree under the primary checkout's fixed
//! isolation directory, named by an identifier that never changes, and
//! reused by one task after another. Reuse is what makes isolation cheap:
//! ignored artifacts — build caches, dependency directories — survive from
//! one task to the next, and the number of directories is bounded by peak
//! concurrency rather than by history.
//!
//! Which directories are slots is not inferred from where they sit or what
//! they are called: the isolation directory is shared with people and their
//! agents, who add worktrees there too. A slot is a checkout carrying the
//! record UZE writes when it makes one ([`record`]); every other worktree is
//! somebody else's, and nothing here resets, reuses or removes it. Beyond
//! that record, a slot's state is derived from the directories Git
//! registers, the tasks recorded for the project, and whether any process
//! is working inside it ([`Presence`]).
//!
//! Nothing that can hold work is removed here on any automatic path. A
//! dirty tree, or a branch with commits the target lacks, is parked; the
//! two removals that are safe — a branch fully contained in the target, and
//! the *directory* of a free slot beyond the spares the pool keeps, its
//! branch kept — are the only ones offered.
