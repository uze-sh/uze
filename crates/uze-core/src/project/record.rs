//! What UZE has recorded about one project, and how a sweep finds it.
//!
//! A project's records — its agents, their conversations, its prompt
//! history — live in one directory keyed by
//! [`harness_runtime::project_id_for`], which is a one-way hash. So the
//! directory names the root it was written for, and that one fact is what
//! makes the id reversible: a sweep of [`UzeHome::projects_dir`] can see
//! every project UZE knows *and* locate each one's checkouts, which four
//! directories keyed by the same hash and no marker between them could
//! not.
//!
//! It is the same answer [`harness_runtime::PROJECTION_MARKER`] already
//! gives the generated tree, for the same reason: naming the root makes a
//! sweep a `readdir` rather than an exercise in reading back what
//! something derived.
