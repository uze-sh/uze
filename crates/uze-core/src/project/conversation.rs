//! The conversation an agent is in, remembered for the agent.
//!
//! # Bound to the agent, never to the directory
//!
//! A slot is reused, and a space's root is shared by every agent in it:
//! the directory an agent stands in was somebody else's yesterday, or is
//! somebody else's right now. A conversation keyed on the directory would
//! therefore hand one agent another's history. Keyed on the agent's
//! identity, a recycled slot simply finds nothing, and a task given its
//! slot back finds exactly what it left.
//!
//! # Advisory, not authoritative
//!
//! Everything here answers one question — should this launch resume, and
//! what — and the answer "no idea" is always safe: the agent starts fresh.
//! So an unreadable, corrupt or unknown-schema document reads as *no
//! record* rather than as an error. The task store refuses a schema it does
//! not know because guessing at a task's state could destroy work; this
//! document only decides whether a conversation is carried over, and
//! refusing to launch over it would trade a lost conversation for a lost
//! agent.
//!
//! # Storage
//!
//! One JSON document per agent, under
//! `UzeHome::state_dir()/conversations/<project id>/<agent id>.json` — the
//! same project key `state/tasks/<project id>.json` uses, so both are
//! outside every checkout by construction. One file per agent rather than a
//! field on the task store, because a launch writes this and launches
//! happen in their own processes: two agents starting at once would
//! otherwise rewrite one document and drop each other's work.
