//! Vendor-neutral concurrent-work isolation.
//!
//! See `openspec/changes/add-portable-worktree-policy/` for the change that
//! introduced it; its ADR is numbered when that change is archived.
//!
//! Isolation itself is performed where UZE launches an agent, by choosing
//! its working directory — deterministic, and requiring nothing of the
//! harness; the slots it chooses among live in [`crate::checkout`]. What
//! lives here is the small remainder that cannot be delivered that way:
//!
//! - the fixed layout every layer must agree on (`.worktrees/<id>`,
//!   branch `agent/<id>`), and the lexical questions asked of it;
//! - what a project declares — what happens to finished work;
//! - the text projected into the project's shared instruction file, whose
//!   only audience is a writer UZE did not place: a subagent spawned inside
//!   a harness session.
//!
//! Deliberately *not* here: any instruction to create a top-level worktree.
//! A harness with its own worktree primitive activates on exactly that kind
//! of instruction, and would isolate a second time on top of the checkout
//! UZE already placed it in.

             inside `{directory}/`, you are already isolated; do not switch branches.\n\
             - If your working directory is not inside `{directory}/`, you are in the \
             operator's own checkout, on the branch they are on: commit there, as you go, and \
             never switch, reset, stash or clean it — the operator's uncommitted work is theirs. \
             Nothing below about delivery applies to you; the branch already has the name it \
             will keep.\n\
             - Commit your work on your own branch, as you go. Never commit to, merge into, \
             rebase, or reset the target branch{target}: delivery is UZE's — \
             {completion}.\n\
             - If UZE tells you a rebase is paused in your checkout, resolve the conflicts \
             preserving the intent of your change, run `git rebase --continue`, run the \
             project's checks, and end your turn.\n\
             - Before spawning parallel subagents that write files, give each its own checkout \
             so they cannot collide:\n\
             \n\
             ```bash\n\
             git worktree add -b {prefix}<topic> \"$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute \
             --git-common-dir)/../{directory}/<topic>\" HEAD\n\
             ```\n\
             \n\
