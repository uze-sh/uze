//! Project agent environment lock — `agents.lock`.
//!
//! The derived half of the pair [`manifest`] authors. Two rules decide
//! whether a key belongs in this file:
//!
//! 1. **It says something no other line says.** The plugin's name is the
//!    map key, so it is not also a field; a revision belongs to the
//!    marketplace that has one, not repeated onto every plugin inside it;
//!    a field that is permanently empty is not a field.
//! 2. **It is spelled the way `agents.yaml` spells it.** A marketplace is
//!    a `git:` or a `path:` in both files. A tagged union rendered into
//!    YAML (`source: {type: git, url: …}`) is JSON wearing a costume, and
//!    it makes a reader moving between the two files learn the same thing
//!    twice.
//!
//! What resolution adds to a declaration is exactly two things:
//! `revision:` — the immutable commit a Git marketplace was read at — and
//! `integrity:` — a digest of the bytes that landed, recorded only when
//! those bytes cannot change under it. Everything else in the file was
//! already in the manifest, and is repeated here only so the lock stands
//! alone on a machine that has not read one.
//!
//! Vendor-neutral, reproducible, Git-versionable. Store/Engine/Integration
//! never parse this file; only Core's serializer and Application's
//! project-environment use cases do.
//!
//! [`manifest`]: crate::manifest
