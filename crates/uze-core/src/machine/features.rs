//! What this build offers, and what it is still deciding.
//!
//! A feature here is a surface of the product that exists in the code but
//! is not finished enough to be part of what a person downloads. The
//! alternative it replaces is the one every project reaches for first —
//! leaving the half-built screen in and calling it Beta — which makes
//! every release a promise nobody meant to make.
//!
//! Resolved at runtime rather than through a Cargo feature, for three
//! reasons. The vocabularies it gates (a route, a scope, an action) are
//! exhaustive enums with tests that walk them, and conditional variants
//! would put `cfg` in every one of those walks. A build without the Cargo
//! feature would stop compiling the code it hides, so CI would stop
//! testing it — a flag whose purpose is to defer a decision must not
//! delete the evidence the decision needs. And a developer should see
//! their own unfinished work without passing a flag to build it.
//!
//! So: **off in a release build, on in a development one**, and
//! `UZE_FEATURES` overrides either way. `cargo install` (what `make
//! install` runs) and the release matrix are release builds, so what a
//! person downloads never carries one of these.
