//! Generic, vendor-neutral infrastructure for launching a harness process
//! through UZE's PATH shim.
//!
//! Nothing in this module knows a specific harness's CLI shape or vendor
//! behavior — that knowledge lives entirely in each integration's own
//! `IntegrationPort::runtime_contribution` (see `integration.rs`). This
//! module answers three harness-agnostic questions instead: which real
//! executable does a shim-invoked name resolve to (skipping UZE's own shim
//! directory, so the shim can never recurse into itself), and what stable,
//! filesystem-safe id identifies a project across repeat runs. Which
//! project a directory belongs to, and what portable context it carries, is
//! `crate::project_context`'s single answer — not this module's.
//!
//! This is `RUNTIME INFRASTRUCTURE`, not `CONTEXT DELIVERY POLICY`: building
//! this does not by itself decide that runtime projection replaces the
//! existing project-root `CLAUDE.md` bridge
//! (`uze agent context reconcile`'s persistent instruction bridge) — that remains
//! a separate, later decision pending empirical comparison.
