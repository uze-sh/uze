//! One partial repository per marketplace, fetched rather than re-cloned.
//!
//! A marketplace is a Git repository, and UZE asks it three questions: what
//! does it offer, what is in this plugin's directory, and is there anything
//! newer than what a project pinned. Answering them by cloning the whole
//! repository — once to list, once more per plugin installed — paid a
//! network round trip for bytes already on disk, and then threw away the
//! one thing that could answer the third question: `.git`.
//!
//! A mirror is that repository, kept. Cloned without *large* blobs: what
//! travels is commits, trees and every file under a megabyte — which for a
//! marketplace of skills and manifests is all of its content, so reading
//! the catalogue and installing a plugin need no second connection — while
//! a binary somebody committed stays behind until a checkout asks for it.
//! Refreshed by `fetch`, so the second question costs nothing the first did
//! not already pay for.
//!
//! It lives in the cache tier: deleting it costs one clone and never
//! correctness. Nothing here is authoritative, and a package's bytes are
//! never read from a mirror — they are ingested into the Store, which is
//! where every harness reads them and which must stand with this gone.
//!
//! A server that does not offer the filter ignores it and sends everything,
//! so this is a saving where it is available and correct where it is not.
