//! Deciding, per launch, whether an agent resumes or starts.
//!
//! [`conversation`](crate::conversation) is the record; this is what is done
//! with it. Both halves are vendor-neutral: everything specific to a harness
//! arrives through [`IntegrationPort`]'s continuity verbs, so this file
//! names no harness and a fifth one changes nothing here.
//!
//! # Where this runs
//!
//! [`plan`] runs inside the launched process, on the shim — the only place
//! that is reached by *every* relaunch, including the one the terminal
//! runtime performs when it restores a workspace with no client in the room.
//! It therefore does no more than verifying the launch's claim against the
//! record it names — a few `stat`s and one small read — and, on a first
//! launch, one small write. It reads no environment: the shim decides what
//! the launch claims and hands it in.
//!
//! [`refresh`] is the other half, and runs where a background answer already
//! runs: it asks the harness which conversation the agent is actually in and
//! writes that back, so a conversation cleared, forked or switched inside
//! the process is the one that resumes rather than the one it began with.
