//! A task: one agent launch UZE made in a project, from the moment it
//! started to the moment its work reached the target.
//!
//! # Identity is not the label
//!
//! An agent's identifier is generated once and never changes; for a task
//! it keys the branch (`agent/<id>`), the checkout it runs in, and its
//! persisted state. The label is derived from the prompt and names the
//! tab. Keeping them apart is what makes a name free to change and a
//! collision impossible. The identifier is an *agent's*, not a task's:
//! an agent that never left the project's own root carries one too, and
//! it is what a reader holds before it knows which kind it has.
//!
//! # Storage
//!
//! One JSON document per project under `UzeHome::state_dir()/tasks/<project
//! id>.json`, outside every checkout by construction, so removing a
//! worktree can never remove history. Written atomically, and carrying a
//! schema version from the first commit: a document from a schema this
//! build does not know is refused, never guessed at.
//!
//! Atomic is not the same as serialized: every change goes through
//! [`locked`], which holds the document for the whole read-modify-write so
//! two of the client's threads cannot each write back the version they
//! read.
