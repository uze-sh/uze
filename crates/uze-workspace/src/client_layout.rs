//! What the TUI keeps of its own shape between runs, in both of its modes.
//!
//! The column the sidebar was dragged to, whether the commit timeline is
//! folded, which management screen was open, how each drawer there was
//! left: all preferences, not transients. Every one of them used to be
//! answered by the client on every launch, so each was a choice the user
//! kept making — and made in the one place where the answer is obviously
//! personal rather than per-repository, which is why this is machine-scoped
//! like [`profile_state`](crate::profile_state) rather than keyed by
//! workspace.
//!
//! One file, one struct, sectioned by who owns each part: the workspace
//! and the management modal over it are one product to the person moving
//! between them, and a preference is remembered by the product, not by
//! whichever surface happened to write it. A surface adds a field to its
//! own section; nothing here decides what a section means.
//!
//! Best-effort by construction: an unreadable or malformed file answers
//! with the defaults. Nothing derives from this, so a TUI that refused to
//! start over its own layout would be trading the product for a preference.
