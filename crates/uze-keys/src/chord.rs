//! The chord grammar: what an operator may write, and what a terminal can
//! actually deliver.
//!
//! This module names no terminal library. A [`Chord`] is what someone wrote
//! in a keymap file or read off the Keys screen; turning a real key event
//! into one is the consuming surface's job, exactly as turning a
//! [`crate::Action`] into a gesture is.
//!
//! Two rules live here rather than with the resolver, because both are
//! properties of the *key*, not of what it was bound to:
//!
//! - Some chords are not chords. A terminal transmits `Ctrl+I` as Tab and
//!   `Ctrl+M` as Enter — there is no encoding that tells them apart, so
//!   binding one is how an operator locks themselves out of their own UI.
//!   [`Chord::parse`] refuses them, naming the key they actually are.
//! - The rest differ in what it takes to deliver them ([`Tier`]). A chord
//!   nobody's terminal can send is worse than an unbound one: it looks
//!   bound and does nothing.
