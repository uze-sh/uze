//! Where an action is live.
//!
//! A scope is one surface of the product — a screen, an overlay, a picker,
//! the pane itself. Callers describe what is currently open as a stack,
//! outermost first, and [`crate::Keymap::resolve`] walks it inward-out.
//!
//! This is the part that used to be an ordering of `match` arms in two
//! dispatchers, with a comment admitting it was easy to get wrong by
//! inserting one in the wrong place — and it *was* wrong: three chords sat
//! above the Git overlay's arm and fired while it was open, while five sat
//! below it and did not. As a stack of values that is a table test, not a
//! reading of the source.
//!
//! Two properties do the work:
//!
//! - A scope that [`Scope::seals`] answers for everything. Nothing outside
//!   it fires, so "what does this key do" has one answer per open surface
//!   rather than one per position in a list. [`Scope::Global`] is the
//!   exception and the only one: leaving and asking for help stay reachable
//!   from anywhere, which is what makes sealing safe.
//! - A scope that [`Scope::consumes_text`] takes ordinary typing as text.
//!   Typing `q` into a filter must never quit, and that is a property of
//!   the filter, not a guard every binding has to remember.
