//! The action vocabulary: every meaning uze's keyboard can reach, named
//! once and independently of any key.
//!
//! This is to input what [`crate::Scope`] is to modality and what a colour
//! token is to appearance: the product decides what an action *means*, and
//! which chord reaches it is a separate, changeable question. Nothing here
//! knows a key.
//!
//! Two properties travel with the name because every surface needs them and
//! none should re-derive them: what the action does in words ([`Action::description`]),
//! which is what the index and the Keys screen read out, and whether
//! performing it destroys something ([`Action::destructive`]), which decides
//! whether it may hold an unmodified letter and whether it may sit first in
//! a menu.
