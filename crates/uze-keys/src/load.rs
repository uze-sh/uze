//! The built-in keymap, and what an operator's file does to it.
//!
//! The split between an error and a warning is the same one the theme
//! loader documents, for the same reason. A file uze cannot make sense of —
//! a chord that is not a chord, two actions reaching for one mnemonic — is
//! an error, and the keymap already in force stays in force, because an
//! operator without a keyboard cannot fix the file that took it away. A file
//! that names something *this build* does not know is a warning: a keymap
//! written for a newer uze must still load on an older one, or every keymap
//! in the wild breaks the first time the vocabulary grows.
