//! The three questions about a repository whose answer cannot change while
//! the path asked about is still there.
//!
//! Each is a `git rev-parse`, each costs a process, and each is asked on a
//! timer rather than once: the workspace client resolves a checkout's root
//! on every badge refresh, and every Git write resolves the common
//! directory to find the write lock. Over one run of the gate journeys the
//! first two were 890 of 3484 Git invocations — a quarter of them — for two
//! answers that never differed.
//!
//! Remembered per path asked, and only when Git answered. A failure is
//! never remembered: a directory that is not a repository yet is exactly
//! the thing `uze setup` and `git init` turn into one, and a remembered
//! "no" would outlive the truth. A path that *stops* being a repository
//! leaves a remembered answer behind, and the command that follows it fails
//! on its own — the same outcome as asking again, one process later.
//!
//! Within a repository, a path is only ever reused by a checkout of that
//! same repository (a slot handed to the next agent), so a reused path
//! answers with what it answered before.
