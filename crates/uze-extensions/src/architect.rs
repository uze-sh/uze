//! The architect surface: a project's architecture, drawn in cells.
//!
//! Mermaid source (flowcharts, C4, sequences) becomes a diagram a
//! terminal can show *without* a graphics protocol, and owning the layout
//! buys what an image cannot: every box is addressable, so a click
//! selects it and lights what it connects to.
//!
//! Everything here is a file somebody wrote. What a project *is* —
//! where its lines are, which of them are hot — is measured rather than
//! written, and is the code surface's map
//! ([`crate::code`]): it looks like a diagram and is not one, and every
//! tile on it is a path the code surface already answers about.
//!
//! It describes and the host draws, like every surface here — but as a
//! [`Layout::Board`], because a drawing is not a document: it is larger
//! than the screen in both directions, it is moved rather than scrolled,
//! and the list of diagrams is how it is switched rather than something
//! to read beside it. What the board shows is a *screen* cut from the
//! whole drawing: this side decides which part, because it owns the
//! position; the host only draws the cells it is handed.
