//! Built-in TUI extensions for the uze workspace client — add-ons that
//! live below `src/ui/` in the dependency graph (`src/` uses this crate,
//! never the reverse), the same relationship `uze-integrations` has to the
//! harness registry: one crate, one module per extension, one registry
//! entry point ([`registry::ExtensionRegistry`]) naming the set.
//!
//! Three ship today, one per question a reader brings to a checkout.
//! [`spec`] answers what it *intends*: the proposals, designs, tasks and
//! specs a spec-driven-development tool keeps, read as documents.
//! [`architect`] answers what somebody *described*, drawing architecture
//! diagrams in cells. [`code`] answers what it *is*, four ways: what
//! changed in it, what it contains, its commit timeline, and a map of
//! where its lines are. Another is a module with its own `CATALOG` entry, one
//! registration in `ExtensionRegistry::builtin`, and one [`ExtensionHit`]
//! variant per surface it draws, not a new crate.
//!
//! # Where a file goes
//!
//! One directory per extension, named after it, with the extension's own
//! surface — its state, its keys, its registry entry — in the file beside
//! it. What more than one extension needs lives under `shared`, created
//! the day a second extension actually reached for it and not before —
//! today that is the canvas a drawing in cells is made on. [`view`] is
//! neither: it is the contract between an extension and whatever draws
//! it, which is why it sits at the root alongside [`Host`], the contract
//! in the other direction.
//!
//! # An extension holds no machine access of its own
//!
//! Everything outside the extension's own process memory — running Git,
//! reading a file, knowing where `$HOME` is — arrives through [`Host`].
//! The extension names what it needs; the host decides whether to oblige.
//! Today it always does, in this process, so nothing observable changes.
//!
//! What changes is that an extension is now a pure function of what it is
//! handed. That is what makes the trust question answerable later: code
//! authored elsewhere cannot reach anything it was not given, and the day
//! an extension runs somewhere else, nothing inside it has to change.
//!
//! # An extension describes; the host draws
//!
//! An extension answers with a [`view::View`] — what it has, never how it
//! looks. The host owns rendering, geometry, and the palette, which is why
//! the copy of `src/ui.rs`'s colour table that used to live here is gone
//! along with the two-sided "keep these in sync by eye" it required. See
//! [`view`] for the rest of the reasoning.
