//! The checkout as a map: where its lines are, and which of them are hot.
//!
//! The one artifact nobody writes. It is measured rather than read — a
//! file's lines, how many commits touched it this year, whether it differs
//! from what was committed — and drawn as a treemap, which is the diagram
//! a grid of cells is best at: rectangles, and no edge to route.
//!
//! **One level at a time.** A treemap that opens directories inside
//! directories spends most of its ink on borders and most of its names on
//! three letters and a cut. So a level draws its own children and nothing
//! below them — each tile large enough to carry a whole name and what it
//! measures — and a directory is *entered* rather than unfolded. How many
//! tiles are on the screen is then a property of the directory being
//! looked at, never of the repository's size, which is what makes the map
//! read the same in a project of ten files and one of ten thousand.
//!
//! Unlike every other drawing here it has no size of its own. A map is
//! for seeing the whole, so it is laid out *for* the space it is given and
//! laid out again when that changes, and going closer is entering a
//! directory rather than moving a board. That is why what is selected is a
//! path and never an index: the next layout would give the index to
//! another tile.
