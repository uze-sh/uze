//! Syntax highlighting, for the modes that show a file's own text.
//!
//! Its own module because the diff [`super::diff`] draws, the file
//! [`super::editor`] opens and the code blocks [`super::markdown`] renders
//! all colour source code, and the alternative was a copy of the syntect
//! plumbing each — the shape where a fallback theme is fixed in one place
//! and left wrong in the others.
//!
//! Everything here is loaded once per process and shared: `syntect`'s
//! default syntax and theme sets are megabytes of parsed data, and
//! rebuilding them per file is what makes a highlighter feel slow.
//!
//! Colour produced here travels to the host as [`Rgb`] rather than as a
//! [`crate::view::Role`], because it comes from the syntax theme the way
//! an image's colour comes from its pixels — see [`crate::view::Rgb`].
