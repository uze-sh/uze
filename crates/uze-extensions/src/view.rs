//! What an extension shows, as data.
//!
//! An extension answers with its content; the host draws it. That split is
//! the whole point of this module, and it buys three things at once:
//!
//! - **The host's design system stays the host's.** Chrome colour is a
//!   [`Role`], resolved against the palette the rest of the TUI already
//!   uses, so an extension can neither drift from it nor need a copy of it.
//! - **Geometry has one owner.** The host laid the rows out, so the host
//!   knows which row a click landed on. An extension never computes a
//!   rectangle and never hit-tests.
//! - **Nothing here is tied to this process.** Every type is plain data. If
//!   an extension is ever authored somewhere else, this is already the
//!   contract; today it just happens to be passed by value.
//!
//! The vocabulary is deliberately small and grows only when a *second*
//! extension needs the same primitive. One extension wanting a widget is a
//! special case; two are evidence.

/// The space the host has for the view. Advisory: the extension uses it to
/// decide how much to produce, not where to put it.
