//! How an edge gets from one box to another.
//!
//! A shortest-path search over the cell grid itself, rather than channels
//! reserved by the layout: the grid is small, the search is exact about
//! what is already drawn, and it needs no special case for an edge that
//! climbs back up, leaves a boundary or has to go around the outside.
//!
//! What makes the result read as a diagram is in the costs. A bend is
//! dear, so lines run straight; crossing another line is dearer, so they
//! go around when around is near; and running *along* a foreign line is
//! refused outright, because two edges sharing cells are one edge to
//! whoever reads it. The exception is deliberate — edges with the same
//! source, or the same target, may share a trunk and fork, which is how
//! a hand-drawn diagram does it too.
//!
//! A region costs the same way. An edge with an end inside one may cross
//! its wall and stand in it as freely as its own members do; one with
//! neither end inside pays for every cell it spends there, and pays
//! again to run alongside the wall. That is the whole of what makes a
//! boundary legible: a line through it says the two ends have something
//! to do with what it encloses, and until a line has to earn that, most
//! of them say it by accident.
