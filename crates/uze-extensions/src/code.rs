//! The workspace TUI's code surface — one place for the four things a
//! person asks of the checkout a tab is standing in: what changed in it,
//! what it contains, what happened to it, and what it is *made of*.
//!
//! # Why one extension and not two
//!
//! The diff and the file tree shipped separately first, and using them
//! showed why that is wrong. The flow this product is for is **agent
//! first → diff → and only last, touch the real file**: the diff is where
//! a person's contact with the work begins, and editing is the exception
//! at the end. So "I see it in the diff, let me fix that line" is the
//! most-crossed seam there is, and two surfaces put a close, an open and
//! a re-navigation to *the same file* in the middle of it.
//!
//! The merge is not a de-duplication. What was genuinely shared already
//! is: the host draws both (`src/ui/extension_view.rs`), and highlighting
//! is `shared::highlight`. The two navigators only look alike —
//! [`changes`] compacts a flat, complete list from `git status`, and
//! [`files`] flattens a partial tree that grows as directories are
//! opened. What one extension can have and two cannot is a **selection
//! that survives the switch**, and that is the whole of the value.
//!
//! # The rule that keeps it from rotting
//!
//! No handler branches on the mode to decide what the state *means*. The
//! mode decides who is *asked*; each half answers about the same path and
//! knows nothing about the other. [`changes`] answers "the diff of this
//! path", [`files`] answers "the tree containing it", [`editor`] answers
//! "the text of it".
//!
//! This is why the selection is a [`PathBuf`] rather than an index into
//! the changed files: an index cannot mean anything to a tree that lists
//! directories on demand, and a path means the same thing to both — which
//! is also what a person means by "this file".
//!
//! [`map`] is the fourth half and the newest, and it is here for the same
//! reason rather than beside the diagrams it was first drawn with. A
//! treemap of a checkout looks like an architecture diagram and is not
//! one: nobody writes it, it says nothing about what the project was
//! meant to be, and every tile on it is a path — the same path the tree
//! and the diff answer about. Finding the file that carries the weight
//! and then reading it is the same seam as finding it in the diff and
//! then editing it, and a surface of its own would put a close and an
//! open in the middle of it.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! The checkout the active tab is *in*, and nothing else. An agent UZE
//! isolated works in `.worktrees/<name>`, and `git worktree list` answers
//! repository-wide from anywhere inside it — so listing linked worktrees
//! here would put every other agent's diff, plus every checkout nobody
//! ever cleaned up, inside a tab that owns exactly one of them.
//!
//! # Nothing here touches a disk
//!
//! Two cadences, both off the drawing thread. The changes half re-reads
//! on a timer ([`Changes::read`]); the files half asks for what it needs
//! one [`FileRequest`] at a time and the host answers. Neither can reach
//! the other: a refresh installs a new [`Changes`] and nothing else,
//! which is what keeps it from eating a buffer someone is typing into.
