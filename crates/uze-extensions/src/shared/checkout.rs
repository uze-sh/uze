//! A checkout, as a surface's frame says it.
//!
//! Two surfaces open on one and name it, and this is the one part of a
//! surface a reader compares *across* surfaces: whichever one is up, the
//! answer to "which checkout am I in, and on what" has to be the same
//! sentence in the same place. Said twice, it stops being said the same
//! way, and then the reader works it out twice.
//!
//! It is two lines on two edges, not one. What the surface *is* belongs
//! at the top, where a title goes and where it is read once. Where it is
//! *open* belongs at the foot, because that is the question a reader
//! comes back to — and a title that answered both put the thing said
//! once and the thing looked up repeatedly in one run of text, at which
//! point neither is found quickly.
