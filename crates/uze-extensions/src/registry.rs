//! Built-in extension registry — the TUI-side mirror of
//! `uze-integrations::registry::IntegrationRegistry`: the single
//! composition root that knows which extensions exist, in registration
//! order. Everything that lists extensions (the management TUI's
//! Extensions screen) consumes the registry or the catalog entry it
//! exposes, never a hand-maintained list of its own. Adding an extension
//! means one module under `crates/uze-extensions/src/` and one entry in
//! `builtin` — nothing else in the product needs to know it exists.
