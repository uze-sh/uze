//! The vocabulary of variables a launch stamps into a pane.
//!
//! Two parties write into a pane's environment on purpose: the server, when
//! it spawns the pane (`UZE_PANE`, and whatever the client asked the launch
//! to carry), and uze's PATH shim, when it `exec`s into a harness
//! (`UZE_SHIM_NAME`, `UZE_SHIM_PID`). Every descendant of those processes
//! inherits the lot, and the server itself is routinely one of them — it
//! is started by whatever `uze` first needed it, which in this project is
//! usually a `uze` run from inside a shimmed agent. So the same list serves
//! two ends: it names what a launch may carry, and what a pane must never
//! inherit from the process that spawned it.
//!
//! The server interprets none of these values. The agent identity is a
//! string the client chose and the shim reads back; what it means is the
//! client's and the shim's business, which is why the name lives here, in
//! transport, and not with either of them.
