//! What the operating system knows about a process this crate did not spawn.
//!
//! Four questions — who is on the other end of a socket, what image is a pid
//! running, where is it standing, what did it inherit — and every one of them
//! is a fact only the kernel holds. Linux answers all four through `/proc`;
//! macOS has no `/proc` and answers them through `libproc` and `sysctl`.
//!
//! They live together here, rather than beside the code that asks, because
//! the *policy* built on top of them is identical everywhere and should be
//! written once. `runtime.rs` used to carry a `#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]`
//! copy of each decision next to a `None`-returning stub for everywhere
//! else, which meant the rule ("the listener counts only when it runs this
//! same executable") existed in a form no other platform could ever run.
//!
//! Every function returns `Option`, and a platform with no answer says
//! `None` rather than guessing. A caller must treat `None` as *unknown* and
//! never as *no* — the difference matters most to `peer_pid`, where the
//! wrong reading of it would tear down a healthy server.
