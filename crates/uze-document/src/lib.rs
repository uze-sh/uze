//! How a record written by another build is read by this one.
//!
//! Every UZE on a machine meets state a previous UZE left there, and what
//! it does about it used to be each module's own decision: one refused, one
//! set the bytes aside, one discarded them without a word, one warned and
//! read on anyway. Four answers to one question, and nine documents with no
//! version at all — so a release that moved three shapes at once cost an
//! operator their spaces, even though the step that mattered was *dropping
//! one field*.
//!
//! The rule this module holds is:
//!
//! - **Carrying a record across is the first answer, and it is silent.**
//!   When this build knows the shape a record was written in, it climbs the
//!   [`Ladder`] to the shape written now. Nothing is reported: carrying a
//!   record across is the product working, not an event.
//! - **Setting it aside is the floor, not the policy.** Only a record whose
//!   shape cannot be climbed at all is moved out of the way — never
//!   deleted — so the caller can reconstruct what the world still knows and
//!   report only the residue.
//! - **Recovery has a direction.** A shape this build is *ahead* of is this
//!   build's to climb or set aside. A shape *ahead* of this build is left
//!   exactly as it is: two builds on one machine is the daily state of this
//!   repository, and a rule without a direction has them taking turns
//!   destroying each other's records, each saying it had recovered.
//! - **The shape is read before the record.** Every field of a record is
//!   required, so a document written under an older shape fails `serde` —
//!   `missing field ...` — long before a guard that compares versions could
//!   look at it. Reading [`Declared`] first is what keeps the guard alive
//!   for the one case it exists for.
//! - **A record with no shape at all is shape 1.** That is what a document
//!   written before its kind declared one *is*, and reading it any other
//!   way sets aside every machine's state on the release that adds the
//!   field.
//! - **The judgement happens under the lock that guards the record.** A
//!   reader without it can catch a publication halfway and would set aside
//!   a record that was never broken, so a read-only surface reports what it
//!   saw and moves on; the next mutation heals.
//!
//! A ladder step is a function from one shape to the next, and it is
//! removable once no machine can still be below it. That is what makes this
//! the opposite of the scattered compatibility this project refuses: the
//! current struct stays clean *because* the old shapes live here rather
//! than as optional fields nobody ever deletes.
//!
//! Only records carry a shape. What UZE generated for another program to
//! read, and what UZE remembered from observing, are produced or observed
//! again when they cannot be read — there is nothing in them to carry.
