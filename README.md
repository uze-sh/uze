A compatibility layer for agent tooling: install a plugin once, write one
`AGENTS.md`, and every agent you run gets both through its own most native
surface: Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode and Antigravity today, and whatever
you switch to next. Then run several at once, each in a checkout of its
own or beside you in yours, and close the terminal without losing any of
it.
