# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to agentic coding tools (Claude Code, Codex,
OpenCode, Antigravity CLI) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

uze is a Rust CLI: the package manager and workspace for coding agents
(Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Antigravity CLI). You install a
plugin once; uze stores its bytes centrally and delivers it through each
harness's most native mechanism — a real plugin where one exists, native
capabilities where it doesn't, a safe adapter only as a last resort. It also
maintains one project context file, `AGENTS.md`, and projects it into each
harness's own bridge/config format instead of maintaining four separately.

This repository is itself the official uze marketplace: `marketplace.json` +
`plugins/**` at the root, with `plugins/uze` (the `/uze` Skill) as the one
official plugin today.

## Commands

```bash
cargo build --locked --bin uze                          # debug build
cargo build --locked --release --bin uze                 # release build
make install                                              # install into ~/.cargo/bin (force-rebuild, no version bump, --features telemetry)
cargo run --quiet --bin uze -- --version

cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast                     # full workspace suite (default-members is the root crate only)
cargo test -p uze-core some_test_name                      # single crate / targeted test during iteration
cargo test --test package_containment                       # one top-level integration test file (tests/*.rs)

cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings                  # CI uses --all-targets; plain `clippy -- -D warnings` is the Makefile default
cargo llvm-cov --workspace --summary-only --fail-under-lines 68 --fail-under-regions 69

cargo deny check                                           # licences, advisories, bans, sources (deny.toml); part of `make check`
make attributions                                          # regenerate CREDITS.md (about.hbs + Cargo.lock); CI fails when it drifts

UZE_LOG=info uze doctor                                    # spans and events as text (see docs/observability.md)
make observe                                               # local Jaeger (UI :16686); then OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318 cargo run --features telemetry --bin uze -- doctor
```

`Makefile` wraps all of the above (`make build`, `make test`, `make check`,
etc. — run `make help` for the full list). `ci.yml` (the fast gate) and
`conformance.yml` (the Lab, on Lab-affecting paths and nightly) are the
source of truth for what actually gates a merge; treat `make check` as a
close local proxy, not a guarantee of parity.

### Test execution on WSL (history of the "session dies mid-test" bug)

Until 2026-09-01, running any suite that exercised a child-process timeout
killed the whole WSL login session (`[process exited with code 9]`, the
agent included). It was **not** OOM and not cargo parallelism:
`kill_process_group` in `crates/uze-core/src/subprocess.rs` shelled out to
`/bin/kill -KILL -<pid>`, and procps-ng `kill` parses a negative pid by its
first digit only (`pid = '0' - optopt`), so any child pid starting with `1`
(1000-1999, 10000-19999, ...) became `kill(-1, SIGKILL)`: every process the
user owns. The helper now issues `kill(2)` directly. Never reintroduce a
shell-out to `kill` for negative pids anywhere in the workspace; use
`libc::kill` (or `kill -- -<pid>` if a shell script truly needs it).

`CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2` / `RUST_TEST_THREADS=4` (also `[build] jobs = 2` in
`.cargo/config.toml`) remain as a courtesy to a 4-vCPU VM, not as a
crash-avoidance measure. If a session still dies mid-run, look for a kill
by signal in `journalctl` (`user@1000.service: ... status=9/KILL` at the
same second as `Session N logged out`) before assuming memory pressure.

Run the CLI itself with `cargo run --bin uze -- <args>` or `./target/debug/uze <args>` after a build; `uze workspace` launches the terminal UI; `uze` with no args prints help.

## Code style

Keep the code clean and self-documenting. Prefer expressive names and small,
focused functions over explanatory comments. Add a comment only when it
explains a non-obvious *why* — the rationale behind a decision, an invariant,
a workaround, or a subtle constraint the code alone cannot convey. Never
restate what the code already says; write intent, not implementation.

When the change is in `src/ui/`, chrome comes from `src/ui/widget/` and
colour from `theme` — neither is assembled at the call site. Both are
enforced; see the two entries in Workspace layout.

## What UZE persists

Everything under `$UZE_HOME` belongs to exactly one tier, and the tier is
decided by **what deleting it costs** — never by which module wrote it:

| tier | where | deleting it costs |
|---|---|---|
| bytes | `store/` | the packages, until they are acquired again |
| record | `state/` | the operator: nothing else knows it |
| authored | the root: `config.toml`, `keys.json`, `theme-overrides.json`, `themes/` | the operator's own text |
| generated | `runtime/`, `shims/` | nothing — it is produced again |
| remembered | `cache/` | nothing — it is observed again |

Two things live outside `$UZE_HOME`, inside the repository's own Git
administrative directory, because what they describe lives there: the
`/.worktrees/` line UZE adds to `.git/info/exclude` (the operator's file,
of which UZE owns that one line), and the record in
`.git/worktrees/<admin>/` saying UZE made that checkout — a *record* by the
test above, since nothing else knows it, and one Git deletes with the
worktree it describes. Both are named in `uze-core`'s worktree module.

A thing must not sit in a tier that claims a different cost than it has.
Generated harness content lived at `state/attachments/` for exactly one
letter's distance from `attachments.json`, the ledger that says who owns
what inside it — authoritative-looking, entirely reproducible, and the
answer to "can I delete this" opposite for each.

**Only records declare a shape.** Generated and remembered things are
produced or observed again when they cannot be read; there is nothing in
them to carry. Authored files are text a person writes, so they carry no
shape either: they grow by additive keys, an unknown value reads as the
default, and one that does not parse is reported and never written over.
A new document therefore declares its tier by where `UzeHome` puts it and, if it is a record, its shape and ladder by
implementing `uze_document::Shaped`. Nothing else is needed and nothing
else is allowed: **every path UZE owns is named in `UzeHome`**, and
`every_path_uze_owns_is_named_in_the_map` in
`tests/architecture/layering.rs` fails the build over a path composed
anywhere else. `uze-terminal` is the one sanctioned exception, for the
dependency reason above.

## Dependencies

The dependency surface is small on purpose: ~22 direct external crates
across the workspace. Every addition is a permanent maintenance liability
and part of the binary's supply chain, so choose by **provenance**, not by
whichever crate name matched the search.

Prefer, in this order, and stop at the first tier that can do the job:

1. **The standard library, or a crate already in the workspace.** Ask this
   first. Most additions lose here.
2. **Foundation** — `rust-lang`, `serde-rs`, `tokio-rs`, dtolnay:
   `serde`, `serde_json`, `thiserror`, `libc`, `tokio`.
3. **A de-facto standard with an organization behind it** — `clap`
   (clap-rs), `ratatui`, `crossterm` (crossterm-rs), `toml_edit`
   (toml-rs), `indicatif`/`dialoguer` (console-rs), `anstyle` (rust-cli),
   `unicode-width` (unicode-rs), `alacritty_terminal` (alacritty),
   `portable-pty` (wezterm), `rmcp` (the official MCP Rust SDK).
4. **A single maintainer, but mature and widely adopted** — `syntect`,
   `schemars`. Acceptable, with the trade-off stated in the
   PR.

Refuse, unless there is no alternative and the reason is written down:

- **A `0.0.x` crate.** In semver that range promises nothing; every
  release may break.
- **A crate that has renamed itself.** The identity of a dependency
  moving under the project is a supply-chain event, not branding.
- **A recently published crate with no adoption**, however well its README
  reads. A README is written by the person asking for your trust.
- **A crate whose author publishes many similarly-branded crates** with
  claims disproportionate to their version number.

Always check, and write the answer in the PR that adds it:

- **Who publishes it.** `cargo info <crate>` shows `repository`, but that
  field is set by the publisher — confirm the crate is genuinely published
  from the repository it names.
- **Whether it compiles C.** A build script compiling C costs real money
  here: `release.yml` cross-compiles four targets, two of them musl, and
  already carries a workaround for one such dependency (`onig_sys`, see
  the comment at `release.yml:206`). If a feature flag avoids the C path,
  take it.
- **`cargo deny check` passes.** A new advisory ignore needs a reason *and*
  a way out — `deny.toml`'s existing ignores name the condition that
  removes them, and a new one must do the same. An ignore with no exit is
  a decision to carry the problem forever.
- **Transitive weight.** `cargo tree -p <crate>` before, not after.

None of this applies to a crate the workspace already depends on: use it.

## Documentation hygiene

Do not create permanent Markdown files for implementation notes,
investigation logs, temporary plans, or task reports unless explicitly
requested — prefer ephemeral working notes. Research becomes documentation
only when the information is likely to remain useful, is not better
represented by code/tests/ADR/OpenSpec, and has a clear canonical owner.
Before adding a document, update the existing canonical one when
appropriate; new docs must state their durable purpose and owner, and
prefer updating an existing document over creating a new file.

## Workspace layout

Cargo workspace, edition 2024, MSRV 1.97. Single version source:
`[workspace.package].version` in the root `Cargo.toml` — every crate
inherits it; bump it before any binary is distributed (dev rebuilds don't
need to).

- `.` (binary crate `uze`) — the CLI (`src/main.rs` parses and
  dispatches; `src/cli/` holds the grammar, the help and one module per
  command family), the terminal UI
  (`src/ui.rs`, `src/ui/`), the runtime PATH shim (`src/shim.rs`), and
  `src/command_performance.rs`.
- `crates/uze-core` — the shared foundation and the package manager's
  harness-agnostic domain, organized into five concerns, each a module
  whose own doc says what belongs in it. Read the concern before the
  module: `hook` is a *capability*, and that is a different question from
  where its file sits.
  - `package/` — where a package's bytes come from and where they live:
    acquisition, trust, importers, bundle, naming, store.
  - `capability/` — what a plugin declares, portably: skill, hook.
  - `delivery/` — how a capability reaches a harness: integration,
    router, exposure, engine, state, persistence, reconciliation.
  - `project/` — what a project declares and what UZE writes into it:
    manifest (the file, and the package manager's section), project_lock,
    context, text_region, the `anchor` a project or marketplace roots at.
  - `machine/` — the local environment outside UZE's own state: home,
    detection cache, provisioning, subprocess, shell PATH, harness runtime.

  Public paths stay flat (`uze_core::store`, not `uze_core::package::store`)
  via re-exports at the crate root, which is also where a reader sees which
  concern each module belongs to. Depends on nothing harness-specific and
  must stay that way (see Architecture below), and never on
  `uze-workspace`: that is how the package manager works without the
  workspace, and the compiler is what says so.
- `crates/uze-workspace` — the workspace's domain: the agents UZE launches
  (`task`), their checkouts (`checkout`, `worktree`), the conversation
  each is in and carrying it across a launch (`conversation`,
  `continuity`), how finished work lands (`landing`), what a project
  declares about all of that (`declaration`, reading `agents.yaml`'s
  `workspace:` section, which `uze-core` carries unread),
  and the workspace client's own state (`client_layout`, `prompt_history`,
  `notifications`, `extensions`). Built on `uze-core`; unrelated to
  `uze-terminal`, which owns the panes and knows nothing of agents.
- `crates/uze-application` — the product-facing facade
  (`UzeApplication`) that orchestrates Core + Integrations into
  install/remove/update/context lifecycle operations. `src/application.rs`
  is the facade and its service accessors; `src/application/lifecycle/`
  holds the per-operation modules (add/install/remove/update/attach), and
  `src/application/services/` the workspace's services (tasks, checkouts,
  work), each a directory once it outgrows one file.
- `crates/uze-git` — the one transport for speaking to the Git binary:
  spawn convention, `read`/`write` entry points, and Git's exit code
  reported rather than classified (a non-zero exit is an answer for
  `diff`, `rebase` and `rev-parse --verify`, and a failure elsewhere —
  only the caller knows which). Carries no domain.
- `crates/uze-document` — the one rule for reading a record another build
  wrote: the shape a record declares, the ladder that carries it across,
  and the floor beneath that. A leaf crate naming no domain, no path and
  no harness, because the terminal runtime holds the workspace and reaches
  nothing of UZE's — and a durability rule written in two places is the
  failure it exists to end.
  **A record written in a shape this build knows is carried across, and
  nothing is said about it**: carrying a record across is the product
  working, not an event. Setting one aside is the *floor* — only a shape
  with no rung reaches it — and then what the world still knows is
  reconstructed and only the residue reported. Recovery has a direction: a
  record from a *newer* build is never taken, because two builds on one
  machine is the daily state of this repository. The shape is read before
  the record, and a record with no shape at all is shape 1.
  A ladder step is deletable once no machine can be below it; that is what
  makes this the opposite of scattered compatibility, which this project
  refuses — the current struct stays clean *because* the old shapes live
  in the ladder.
- `crates/uze-platform` — what UZE asks the operating system, answered
  once per platform: processes and their trees (process groups; Job
  Objects), kernel facts about a process (`probe`), cross-process locks, the
  shell an authored line runs in (`sh -c`; Windows PowerShell 5.1), paths,
  the home directory, private files, executables and the image a running
  binary is replaced by, stdio, the desktop's URL openers and the system's
  own tools. **One concept per module, one API per concept, and one
  implementation per platform selected by `cfg` at that module's boundary**
  (`mod unix;`/`mod windows;` behind `use … as imp`): nothing that uses it
  branches on the operating system, and a `cfg!` at a call site anywhere
  else in the workspace is a missing concept here. Distinct per-platform
  data gets distinct types, never optional fields on a shared one. A leaf
  crate naming no domain, no UZE path and no harness, because `uze-core`,
  `uze-git`, the terminal runtime and the binary all need it and none may
  depend on another for it.
- `crates/uze-terminal` — the local terminal runtime: a server owning the
  pseudoterminals and a versioned client protocol, so a pane survives a
  client leaving. Depends on nothing in the workspace but `uze-platform`
  and `uze-document`, whose rule it obeys like everything else that
  persists — the path to its own workspace is the only thing it computes
  for itself.
- `crates/uze-theme` — the design vocabulary: colour `Token`s, named
  `Symbol`s, the theme file schema, and the resolver that completes a
  partial theme from the built-in default. A leaf crate — it resolves no
  path, reads no environment, and names no rendering library, so every
  consumer adapts `uze_theme::Rgb` to what it draws with (`src/ui/theme.rs`
  for ratatui, `src/progress.rs` for the CLI). **Nothing outside
  `src/ui/theme.rs` may name a colour value or write a chrome glyph
  inline** — two rules in `tests/architecture/layering.rs` fail the build
  over it. Name the meaning (`Token::TextMuted`, `Symbol::MarkOfficial`)
  and let the active theme decide what it looks like; add a token or a
  symbol when none of the existing ones says what yours means. Colour that
  genuinely comes from content rather than from the design system — a
  pane's own output, syntax highlighting an extension ships — goes through
  `theme::content`.
- `src/ui/widget/` — the chrome vocabulary: `Surface` (a bordered box),
  `Rule` (an edge hairline), `Button`/`button_row`, `Chip` (a filled
  label standing where a control stands), `Field` (a text input, and the
  caret that is the only thing saying an empty one can be typed into),
  `Toast` (an outcome, stacked top-right and gone on its own clock),
  `row` (a list line's ground, its trailing caption, its title), `text`
  (fitting text to the room there is, and the small-caps forms), `mark`
  (the disclosure chevron), `hint` (the keys that act here),
  `screen_header`, `action_index`, `Scrollbar`, `scrim`, the `fill`/`root`
  grounds, and the `POPUP_H_PAD`/`POPUP_V_PAD`/`TRAILING_PAD` spacing. Nothing in it names
  anything but `theme` and its own siblings. Where `theme` settles what a drawn thing may
  *look* like, this settles what it is *made of*. **Nothing outside
  `src/ui/widget/` may build chrome from ratatui's primitives** —
  `chrome_is_built_from_the_widget_vocabulary` in
  `tests/architecture/layering.rs` fails the build over a `Block::default()`
  anywhere else. Name what it is (`Surface::floating()`, `Surface::card()`,
  `Rule::new(Edge::Right)`) and let the widget decide the hairline, the
  ground and the inset; add a constructor when none of the existing ones
  says what yours means, and never rebuild one at the call site. A widget
  owns none of hit-testing (a caller passes its `Hit` in and registers the
  rects it gets back), no state (ratatui is immediate mode — there is
  nothing to reconcile between frames), and no layout (it fills the rect it
  is handed). Those three are guarded the other way by
  `a_widget_knows_no_model_and_reaches_nothing`, which fails the build on a
  widget naming `TuiModel`, `WorkspaceModel`, the filesystem, the
  environment or a process — the pair keeps a screen from building its own
  chrome and the vocabulary from growing into a screen. It lives here
  rather than in a crate because `ratatui` appears in exactly one manifest,
  the root's, and `uze-theme` and `uze-extensions` deliberately name no
  rendering library.
  Extract on the second *file*, not the second call: a helper three
  callers in one screen share is that screen's, and moving it here only
  makes the vocabulary harder to read. A primitive a screen exports is the
  signal — `clip_line` lived in `management.rs` and four other screens
  reached across for it as `super::super::management::clip_line`.
- `crates/uze-extensions` — built-in TUI extensions. An extension answers
  with a `view::View` (a full-frame surface) or a `view::Section` (a
  collapsible block of one of the host's own columns) and never draws,
  computes geometry, or names a colour; `src/ui/extension_view.rs` renders
  both. Presentation, one directory per extension (`code/` and
  `architect/`) with the extension's own surface in the file beside it,
  one `ExtensionRegistry::builtin` entry, one `ExtensionHit` variant per
  surface it draws. What more than one extension needs lives under
  `shared/`, and only once a second one actually needs it — today that is
  `shared/canvas.rs`, which knows how to put a glyph somewhere and
  nothing about what is being drawn, and `shared/places.rs`, the
  directories `workspace.artifacts` declares, which the host resolves and
  both `architect` and `spec` read from; `view.rs` and `Host` are the two
  contracts and sit at the crate root. `Host` is where every capability
  is granted — including the two that write, which the code surface's
  save and delete are the only callers of.
  `code` is **one** extension covering the checkout's changes, its files,
  its history and its map, because the selection has to survive a switch
  between them and a selection cannot live above two extensions. Its
  rule: no handler branches on the mode to decide what the state *means*
  — the mode decides who is *asked*, and each half answers about the same
  path knowing nothing about the other. The map is there rather than
  beside the diagrams it was first drawn with, because a treemap of a
  checkout only looks like an architecture diagram: nobody writes it, and
  every tile on it is a path the other three halves already answer about.
  `architect` draws what somebody *wrote down* about the project, and
  nothing that is measured. `spec` reads what a checkout *intends*: a
  spec tool's units, found by the marker the tool defines, and the
  project's decision records, found by their shape in the declared
  places, since no tool decides where those live.
- `crates/uze-integrations` — one module per harness
  (`claude`, `codex`, `opencode`, `antigravity`)
  implementing the shared `IntegrationPort` from `uze-core`, plus `shared/`
  for cross-vendor process/path helpers.
- `conformance/` — Harness Conformance Lab (Python): Real Harness +
  Synthetic World isolation evidence. `contract/` states what **every**
  harness must prove, in outcome terms, and names no vendor;
  `harnesses/<vendor>/bindings.py` says how that harness is driven and
  carries no assertion; `scenarios.py` keeps only what is genuinely unique
  to the vendor. A harness that cannot deliver part of a contract declares
  it through `bindings.unsupported` with a reason, which the run records —
  never by omitting the check. Vertical per harness
  (`conformance/harnesses/{antigravity,claude,codex,opencode}/`) in a
  disposable Docker environment — the real harness binary, a synthetic
  provider, zero Internet, zero tokens. Vendor-specific by design; never
  linked into the deterministic suite. Three fixture trees, by owner: the
  deterministic suites' inputs in `tests/_fixtures`; the Lab's own
  marketplace in `conformance/_fixtures/marketplace/`; per-harness session
  and provider state under `conformance/harnesses/<vendor>/fixtures/`. Run with
  `python3 conformance/lab.py --harness <h>`; replay a recorded run with
  `make lab-replay`. `conformance.yml` runs all four verticals (matrix) —
  its own workflow, on the paths that reach the Lab image plus nightly, so
  a docs or web change no longer pays 34 runner-minutes to prove nothing.
  Each vertical runs as two legs (`lab.py --part contract|vendor`), and a
  leg — of the Lab or of the journeys — that already passed against the
  same content of what it reads and the same thing outside the repository
  it drives is reused, not rerun (`.github/scripts/proof.py`); the nightly
  always runs.
  `conformance-stability.yml` is ADR-035's promotion gate (3 clean runs per
  vertical), nightly only.
  Debugging a failure: see the `conformance-debug` skill (fast `--sandbox`
  reproduction loop, seconds not minutes) before iterating against the full
  gate run.
- `tests/` — domain-organized integration suites (one `main.rs` per
  domain: `cli/`, `memory/`, `packages/`, `workspace/`, `lifecycle/`,
  `projection/`, `integrations/`, `acceptance/`), shared test
  infrastructure in `crates/uze-testkit` (isolated `TestEnvironment`,
  `FakeHarness`, canonical/scenario fixtures), and the taxonomy documented
  in `tests/README.md` (L0-L4).
- `playground/` — disposable worlds to try this checkout by hand
  (`make playground-windows`: Windows Sandbox; `make playground-linux`: a
  throwaway WSL distribution) and a
  default local plugin used for manual dogfooding.
- `docs/adr/` — numbered architecture decision records (read before making
  a structural change; recent ones cover generated native-package
  projection, Skill invocation policy, and invocation labels).
- `docs/architecture/*.mmd` — the architecture as Mermaid, drawn by the
  workspace's own architect surface (`agents.yaml`'s `workspace.artifacts`
  covers the directory) and by `uze-extensions`'s tests, so a diagram that stops
  routing is a red build. The one diagram source: there is no separate
  model to keep in sync. `uze agent artifacts check` (`make artifacts`,
  part of `make check`) draws every file in that directory the way the
  surface would and fails on one that does not, or whose box links open no
  file — the tests can only cover
  the eight they name, because `uze-extensions` may not read a filesystem.
  Writing one of these is the `uze:architect` Skill's subject; the accepted
  syntax is never written down anywhere, because the parser is the only
  thing that can answer and it moves.
- `docs/architecture/invariants.md` — properties the architecture actually
  holds today, each tied to the specific test that proves it. Treat this as
  the canonical list of "do not break this" behaviors.
- `openspec/` — active/archived change proposals (spec-driven work log);
  `openspec validate --all --strict` is part of the full gate set.

## Product journeys

`journeys/` is the third test tier: a user's flow performed through the real
CLI and the real TUI in a disposable world, then checked against the machine
it left behind. See `journeys/README.md` for the vocabulary and the
`journey-author` skill for how to write one; the rules that decide *what* a
journey is are here because they govern the shape of the suite.

- **Never validate UZE with UZE.** Every `then` check reads the filesystem,
  Git, the recorded task state or the process table. UZE's own report is the
  subject of a `cmd` step, asserted *against* those checks — never the source
  of truth for another one. This tier exists to catch "exited zero, reported
  the artifact, wrote nothing", and an assertion on UZE's own output cannot.
- **Screen text is a gate, never an assertion.** `expect` proves a gesture
  landed. A claim about what the screen *says* belongs in `src/ui/`'s own
  `TestBackend` tests, where it is cheaper and more precise.
- **Every gesture states its `expect`** — `journey validate` fails a click
  that does not. An untimed gesture is where a suite like this dies, so the
  linter refuses it rather than the reviewer.
- **Chapters are the order a person meets the product**, not subsystems:
  `01-first-run`, `02-packages`, `03-context`, `04-workspace`,
  `05-delivery`, `06-recovery`, `07-upgrade`. The last one is the only
  chapter that runs a *second* binary — the previously released `uze`,
  built once from its tag and kept, never downloaded, so a run is not
  counted as somebody installing that release — because what it proves is
  two binaries meeting on one disk, which no fixture can be wrong about in
  the way a release can. It costs a build, so it is nightly. The numbers are reading order only — every
  journey builds its own world, so none depends on a lower number having run.
  A chapter appears when its first journey does.
- **A scene continues the story; a file starts one over.** Joined by "and
  then" it is a scene; by "also" it is a file. Four things force a file: a
  different world, a claim that does not depend on the story so far, a
  different cadence, and — a property of the runner, not of taste — that a
  run stops at the first failure, so claims sharing a file share a fate.
- **A scene must be load-bearing.** Delete it: a later scene must break, or
  its checks must be the only proof of its own claim. Otherwise it was a
  step, not a claim, and belongs folded into its neighbour.
- **Tags say when it runs, numbers say where it sits.** `gate` is the
  pull-request set; everything runs nightly. A journey that becomes slow
  changes its tag, never its chapter.
- **The index is `journey list`**, read from the files themselves. Do not
  keep a table of what the suite proves — that is the trap the per-harness
  conformance matrix was in until it was parameterized.

A journey that backs a user-facing claim names the page it backs in its
`proves:` field, the way `docs/architecture/invariants.md` names the test
behind each property. `journey validate` fails a `proves:` that no longer
resolves, so a page that moved or was deleted surfaces as a red build, and
whoever changes a flow is told which page to re-read. It catches structural
drift and directs attention; it cannot tell you the prose went wrong, and
nothing can.

## Architecture

Dependency direction is one-way and enforced by tests, not just convention:

```
CLI/TUI (src/)  ──uses──▶  uze-extensions   (presentation: an extension
      ↓                                      describes, src/ui renders)
uze-application  (orchestration: add/install/remove/update/context)
      ↓                 ↓
      ↓          uze-workspace (the workspace's domain: tasks, checkouts,
      ↓                 ↓       landing, conversations)
uze-core         (shared foundation + the package manager: Package, Store,
      ↑           Engine, Router, IntegrationPort, capability/exposure model)
uze-integrations (Claude, Codex, Antigravity, OpenCode — implement IntegrationPort)

uze-git          (transport, no domain — used by core and by extensions)
uze-terminal     (local terminal runtime, depends on nothing here)
```

**`src/` must not name `uze_core::` or `uze_integrations`.** Presentation
consumes read models from `uze-application`; reaching into the domain
directly makes every domain change ripple into the frontend and leaves no
single surface anything else could consume. Enforced by
`tests/architecture/layering.rs::architecture_rules_hold`, and the debt is
**zero** — every remaining reach is `sanctioned` and named. Need something
the domain has? Add it to `uze-application`: a read model, a method on a
service, or a re-export when it is vocabulary a read model is made of.
**Never raise a budget**, and add to `sanctioned` only for a file that is
genuinely not presentation, with the reason written down.

The compiler cannot enforce this in place of the test, because
`src/shim.rs` and `src/bin/uze-harness-matrix.rs` share the binary crate
and legitimately name the domain. Making `rustc` the enforcer would mean
giving them crates of their own — a decision about what the `uze` binary
is, not a tidy-up.

**An extension never draws, and reaches nothing it was not handed.** It
returns a `view::View` or a `view::Section` — the host owns rendering,
geometry, hit-testing and the palette — and every other capability
(running Git, reading a file, resolving `$HOME`) arrives through
`uze_extensions::Host`, implemented in
`src/ui/extension_host.rs`. `uze-extensions` depends on no UZE crate at
all, and names no process, filesystem or environment API; the architecture
suite fails on each. An extension is code UZE runs in its own
process, which is a different trust class from plugin bytes a harness
reads; see ADR-041 in `docs/adr/`.

**Nothing the workspace client draws waits on a repository.** Every Git
read it makes — the badge, the sidebar timeline, a commit's account, the
changes overlay and its per-file diff — runs on a thread and answers
through a channel, and so do the two other unbounded operations: placing a
new agent (`git worktree add` plus the project's `setup`) and slot
reconciliation. Two tests hold it: `src/ui/orchestrator/` (the render and
input halves) may not name `WorkspaceHost` at all, save `reads.rs`, where
the reads live; and every mention of it there and in
`src/ui/orchestrator.rs` must sit inside a `thread::spawn`. Every answer
carries the question it was asked, so one that arrives after the viewer
moved on is dropped rather than drawn. Adding a read means a `spawn_*` in
`orchestrator/reads.rs` and an `absorb_*` beside the existing ones, never
an inline call.

**Speak to Git through `uze-git`.** Never spawn `git` directly: two callers
with two exit-code conventions is what this replaced, and a repository
write lock cannot be complete if a module spawns Git around it. Reads go
through `read`, writes through `write`. The one exception is
`acquisition::git`, which clones *untrusted remote* repositories and
therefore strips the environment rather than inheriting it — a different
threat model, not a second convention. Both are sanctioned by name in the
architecture suite; a third spawn fails it.

`uze-core` production code never names a specific harness (Claude/Codex/
OpenCode/Antigravity) — enforced by
`tests/integrations/identity.rs::core_never_names_a_vendor_harness`; the
same neutrality holds for `uze-application` and `src/` (CLI/TUI),
enforced by `application_never_names_a_vendor_harness` and
`cli_and_tui_never_name_a_vendor_harness`. Vendor-specific knowledge lives
only in `uze-integrations`, whose `registry::IntegrationRegistry`
(`builtin`/`isolated`) is the single composition root that names the
concrete integration types — application, the runtime shim, and tooling
all consume the registry or the `IntegrationPort` contract. A new harness
should require no semantic change to Store, Engine, or Router and no
change to core/application/CLI/TUI — only a new integration vertical, one
registry entry, conformance, and docs. Antigravity CLI is the Google-family
v0 harness (ADR-027).

Key domain concepts (see `docs/architecture/invariants.md` for the guarded
properties):

- **Store** (`uze-core::store`) owns installed package bytes and is the
  single source of truth; it never writes anything a harness reads, and
  integrations never mutate it.
- **One Skill capability; invocation policy is its semantics**: explicit
  user action vs. background knowledge is the `invoke: {model, user}`
  block in SKILL.md (ADR-030), never a second capability kind — no
  canonical `Command`, no `commands/` surface. Integrations translate the
  policy into vendor-specific encodings; Store bytes stay verbatim.
- **Portable Hooks (ADR-033, compiled per ADR-040)**: one authored
  `hooks.json` is the canonical Hook surface, and its handler contract is
  `HOOK_*` environment in, exit code out (0 allows, 3 denies with the
  reason on stderr, anything else fails by the group's effect), bounded
  output and a per-handler timeout, first-deny-wins, fail-open for
  observational vs fail-closed for deny/ask/transform. The contract is
  compiled at install time into the delivered artifact — a generated POSIX
  `sh` wrapper for the command-hook harnesses, the owned OpenCode bridge —
  with no `uze` on the execution path; a platform with no template is
  reported Unsupported, never adapted. Every projection (merged config
  entries, the generated Antigravity plugin, the OpenCode bridge) is
  receipt-owned, content-identity inspected, and never touches foreign
  hooks/plugins/order.
- **Machine and project scope are independent**: `uze setup`, `uze doctor`,
  `uze theme`, `uze market …` and `uze plugin …` are machine-scoped
  (`~/.uze`); `uze <plugin>@<market>`, `uze install` (aliased `uze i`),
  `uze remove`, `uze status` and `uze agent …` (`agent work name|split|join|list`,
  `agent context inspect|plan|reconcile`) are project-scoped
  (`agents.yaml`, `agents.lock`, `AGENTS.md`). Neither touches the other's state — see
  `docs/adr/019-explicit-project-machine-boundary-in-cli-command-grammar.md`.
  `uze install` converges the manifest in both directions — a plugin dropped
  from `agents.yaml` leaves `agents.lock`, while the Store and every harness
  keep it, because other projects share those and taking it off the machine
  is `uze plugin remove` — and leaves the project context reconciled, so
  declaring an environment and projecting it are one command rather than
  two.
- **The header says what is happening; a toast says what happened.** The
  workspace client's header carries one line, only ever about work in
  flight, with a spinner and no clock — it goes when the work ends, which
  is where the operation's own pending flag is cleared rather than where
  anything is said about it, since an operation that finishes with nothing
  to report still finishes. Outcomes are toasts, stacked top-right over
  the pane: a title and a detail — both required, since a message worth
  interrupting for is worth saying what it is *about*, and one row of
  words over an empty one reads as a rendering fault. The hue is on the
  mark alone and the ground is neutral, because four tinted boxes stacked
  make the reader parse the surface before the words. They carry the
  seconds they have left; the one that needs answering carries none and
  stays until it is. A header that said both had to choose between them,
  and what it dropped was whichever arrived second.
- **`uze agent …` is an audience, not a category**: its reader is an agent
  UZE launched, not a person, so it is hidden from `uze --help` and
  documented in the region UZE projects into `AGENTS.md` — each audience
  reads one surface. `agent context inspect|plan|reconcile` sits there for
  that reason and no other: the project scope is unchanged, but the
  region-by-region detail it answers with is something only a writer of
  `AGENTS.md` acts on. A person asks `uze status` whether the project is
  ready and `uze install` to make it so, so anything a person needs to
  know about the context belongs in `status`, never in a fourth verb of
  their own. `uze agent work name <type>/<subject>` is how work
  acquires the branch a reviewer sees and the label an operator reads; the
  vocabulary it is judged against is `workspace.branch` in `agents.yaml`.
  Work that reaches its first commit still unnamed is named from that
  commit's subject, judged against the same vocabulary — a Git fact read on
  the evaluation pass, never a harness feature. That derivation fires once
  and never again; asking by name renames, however often it is asked.
  `uze agent work split|join|list` is how an agent gives its subagents
  checkouts of their own and brings their work back: a subagent's checkout
  is a slot UZE recorded as that agent's child, never a worktree made with
  Git by hand, which UZE would neither see nor protect.
- **`agents.yaml` is authored, `agents.lock` is derived**: the manifest holds
  what the project declared (marketplaces and plugins at the root, the
  workspace's policy under `workspace:`);
  the lock holds only what resolving it produced — a commit per marketplace and
  a digest per package — so it is regenerated, never repaired, and deleting it
  loses nothing. A marketplace is a Git repository whether it is spelled as a
  URL or as a local path.
- **Native > Generated Native > Safe Adaptation > Unsupported** delivery
  precedence per capability per harness. "Native" means the harness offers
  an officially supported mechanism preserving canonical semantics — not
  necessarily the same physical primitive across vendors. The canonical
  capability is the Skill; its portable semantics are *who may invoke it*
  (invocation policy, ADR-030), and each integration translates that policy
  into the vendor's own encoding.
- **Derived artifacts are non-authoritative and rebuildable** — anything an
  integration generates (a generated native package, a projected bridge
  file) can be safely deleted and regenerated from the Store + Engine
  alone.
- **Receipts drive lifecycle safety**: every managed filesystem artifact
  (symlink, generated directory, config entry) is tracked by a typed
  receipt; drift or an unreadable ledger blocks destructive mutation rather
  than authorizing one; removal always inspects current state before
  detaching (inspect-before-detach).
- **The runtime PATH shim** (`src/shim.rs`, `uze-core::harness_runtime`) is
  an experimental mechanism that projects `AGENTS.md` into a harness
  without writing into the project; it must never recursively invoke
  itself — this is a named, tested boundary
  (`tests/integrations/runtime_boundary.rs`).
- **`command_performance.rs`** enforces that every CLI leaf command is
  classified as `Budgeted` (low-millisecond, cache-backed via
  `UzeApplication::detect_cached`) or `JustifiedSlow` with a stated reason;
  an unclassified command fails `cargo test` by name
  (`tests::every_cli_command_is_classified`). Classify any new command you
  add here.
- **Project context bridging**: `AGENTS.md` is the portable baseline for
  project instructions. `CLAUDE.md` is the one generated bridge
  (`@AGENTS.md`) produced by `uze agent context reconcile` — don't hand-edit
  their managed regions in a *project uze manages*; this repository's own
  root `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` are the exception, maintained directly since
  this is uze's own source, not a uze-managed target project.

`IntegrationPort` (in `uze-core::integration`) is intentionally kept as one
trait proven by conformance tests across all four harnesses, rather than
split into per-capability traits (`PackageDelivery`, `SkillDelivery`, …) —
that fragmentation has been considered and rejected absent a concrete
implementation problem forcing it.

## Authoring plugins

- Creating a plugin is agent work, driven with these deterministic verbs, none of which needs anything but `uze` on the machine: `uze agent market create <name> --at <dir> [--description <text>]` scaffolds a marketplace as a Git repository, registers and links it in one step (or skip to the next verb when a marketplace already exists — ask `uze market list` for the names); `uze agent plugin create <name> --market <market> [--hook] [--mcp] [--instructions]` scaffolds a plugin into it; `uze agent plugin check <path>` and `uze agent market check <path>` validate offline — run the check before any install, then `uze install -m <plugin>@<market>` and iterate on the files, which the linked marketplace already reads. The guided script for the whole loop is the `uze:author` skill.

## Concurrent work isolation

This section is for an agent `uze workspace` launched. An agent started any other way can ignore it: nothing below applies to it, and the `uze agent work` commands it names refuse outside the workspace.

- As soon as a user message gives the conversation a clear topic — normally the first message — name your work: `uze agent work name <type>/<subject>`. Types this project accepts: `feat|fix|docs|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|chore|style|revert`. The subject is ideally one or two words, never more than three, naming the intention, not a description of the task — `fix/branch-naming`, not `fix/correct-the-problem-with-agent-branch-names`. The command always updates your label. In a checkout of your own it also renames your branch; in the operator's checkout only your label changes. Work that reaches a commit still unnamed is named by UZE from that commit's subject. Name it again with the same command whenever the work turns out to be something else — the last name given is the one that stands.
- An agent UZE isolated works in a checkout of its own under `.worktrees/<id>`, on branch `agent/<id>`. If your working directory is inside `.worktrees/`, you are already isolated; do not switch branches.
- If your working directory is not inside `.worktrees/`, you are in the operator's own checkout, on the branch they are on: commit there, as you go, and never switch, reset, stash or clean it — the operator's uncommitted work is theirs. Nothing below about delivery applies to you; the branch already has the name it will keep.
- Commit your work on your own branch, as you go. Never commit to, merge into, rebase, or reset the target branch: delivery is UZE's — UZE rebases your branch onto the target, runs the project's checks and publishes it, then asks you to open the request for it; commit on your branch and stop until it does.
- If UZE tells you a rebase is paused in your checkout, resolve the conflicts preserving the intent of your change, run `git rebase --continue`, run the project's checks, and end your turn.
- Before spawning parallel subagents that write files, give each its own checkout: `uze agent work split <topic>` prints the path of one cut from your current commit — hand that path to the subagent. When it is done, commit in both checkouts and run `uze agent work join <topic>` to bring its commits onto your branch; on a conflict, resolve it in the subagent's checkout, run `git rebase --continue` there, and join again. `uze agent work list` shows them. Never make a worktree with Git for this: UZE only knows the checkouts it made. An agent in the operator's checkout has no branch of its own to join into, and runs its subagents one after another instead.
